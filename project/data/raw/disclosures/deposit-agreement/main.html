<p>Important Information about Procedures for Opening a New Account. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.</p>
<p>What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver&#8217;s license or other identifying documents.</p></div>

<p>Agreement. This document, along with any other documents we give you pertaining to your account(s), is a contract that establishes rules which control your account(s) with us. Please read this carefully and retain it for future reference. If you sign the signature card or open or continue to use the account, you agree to these rules. You will receive a separate schedule of rates, qualifying balances, and fees if they are not included in this document. If you have any questions, please call us.</p>
<p>This agreement is subject to applicable federal laws, the laws of the state of Virginia and other applicable rules such as the operating letters of the Federal Reserve Banks and payment processing system rules (except to the extent that this agreement can and does vary such rules or laws). The body of state and federal law that governs our relationship with you, however, is too large and complex to be reproduced here. The purpose of this document is to:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>1. summarize some laws that apply to common transactions;</li>
<li>2. establish rules to cover transactions or events which the law does not regulate;</li>
<li>3. establish rules for certain transactions or events which the law regulates but permits variation by agreement; and</li>
<li>4. give you disclosures of some of our policies to which you may be entitled or in which you may be interested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If any provision of this document is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. We may permit some variations from our standard agreement, but we must agree to any variation in writing either on the signature card for your account or in some other document. Nothing in this document is intended to vary our duty to act in good faith and with ordinary care when required by law.</p>
<p>As used in this document the words &#8220;we, &#8221; &#8220;our, &#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; mean the financial institution and the words &#8220;you&#8221; and<br />
&#8216;your&#8221; mean the account holder(s) and anyone else with the authority to deposit, withdraw, or exercise control over the funds in the account. However, this agreement does not intend, and the terms &#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221; should not be interpreted, to expand an individual&#8217;s responsibility for an organization&#8217;s liability. If this account is owned by a corporation, partnership or other organization, individual liability is determined by the laws generally applicable to that type of organization. The headings in this document are for convenience or reference only and will not govern the interpretation of the provisions. Unless it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this document should be construed so the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.</p></div>

You will pay any additional reasonable charges for services you request which are not covered by this agreement.</p>
<p>Each of you also agrees to be jointly and severally (individually) liable for any account shortage resulting from charges or overdrafts, whether caused by you or another with access to this account.

<div class="block">
<p>Deposits. We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items, other than cash, we accept for deposit (including items drawn &#8220;on us&#8221;). Before settlement of any item becomes final, we act only as your agent, regardless of the form of endorsement or lack of endorsement on the item and even though we provide you provisional credit for the item. We may reverse any provisional credit for items that are lost, stolen, or returned. Unless prohibited by law, we also reserve the right to charge back to your account the amount of any item deposited to your account or cashed for you which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to us due to an allegedly forged, unauthorized or missing endorsement, claim of alteration, encoding error or other problem which in our judgment justifies reversal of credit. You authorize to attempt to collect previously returned items without giving you notice, and in attempting to collect we may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond the midnight deadline. Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in, foreign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect on final collection in U.S. dollars. We are not responsible for transactions by mail or outside depository until we actually record them. We will treat and record all transactions received after our &#8220;daily cutoff time&#8221; on a business day we are open, or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next business day that we are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit. If we accept a third-party check for deposit, we may require any third-party endorsers to verify or guarantee their endorsements, or endorse in our presence.</p></div>

                    <a href="#toggle_6287683835bb2e64222559">Withdrawals Generally</a>
                </p>
<div class="toggle_container" style="display:none;">
<div class="block">
<p>Withdrawals Generally. Unless clearly indicated otherwise on the account records, any of you, acting alone, who signs to open the account or has authority to make withdrawals may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the account balance at any time. Each of you (until we receive written notice to the contrary) authorizes each other person who signs or has authority to make withdrawals to endorse any item payable to you or your order for deposit to this account or any other transaction with us.</p>
<p>Postdated Checks. A postdated check is one which bears a date later than the date on which the check is written. We may properly pay and charge your account for a postdated check even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless we have received written notice of the postdating in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act. Because we process checks mechanically, your notice will not be effective and we will not be liable for failing to honor your notice unless it precisely identifies the number, date, amount and payee of the item.<br />
Checks and Withdrawal Rules. If you do not purchase your check blanks from us, you must be certain that we approve the check blanks you purchase. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which you attempt on forms not approved by us or by any method we do not specifically permit. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which is greater in number than the frequency permitted, or which is for an amount greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the date you initiate it) to apply the frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on the account until your identity is verified.</p>
<p>Even if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later. If you violate the stated transaction limitations (if any), in our discretion we may close your account or reclassify it as a transaction account. If we reclassify your account, your account will be subject to the fees and earnings rules of the new account classification.</p>
<p>If we are presented with an item drawn against your account that would be a &#8220;substitute check, &#8221; as defined by law, but for an error or defect in the item introduced in the substitute check creation process, you agree that we may pay such item.</p>
<p>See the funds availability policy disclosure for information about when you can withdraw funds you deposit. For those accounts to which our funds availability policy disclosure does not apply, you can ask us when you make a deposit when those funds will be available for withdrawal. An item may be returned after the funds from the deposit of that item are made available for withdrawal. In that case, we will reverse the credit of the item. We may determine the amount of available funds in your account for the purpose of deciding whether to return an item for insufficient funds at any time between the time we receive the item and when we return the item or send a notice in lieu of return. We need only make one determination, but if we choose to make a subsequent determination, the account balance at the subsequent time will determine whether there are insufficient available funds.</p>
<p>A Temporary Debit Authorization Hold Affects Your Account Balance. On debit card purchases, merchants may request a temporary hold on your account for a specified sum of money, which may be more than the actual amount of your purchase. When this happens, our processing system cannot determine that the amount of the hold exceeds the actual amount of your purchase. This temporary hold, and the amount charged to your account, will eventually be adjusted to the actual amount of your purchase, but it may be up to three days before the adjustment is made. Until the adjustment is made, the amount of funds in your account available for other transactions will be reduced by the amount of the temporary hold. If another transaction is presented for payment in an amount greater than the funds left after the deduction of the temporary hold amount, that transaction will be a nonsufficient funds (NSF) transaction if we do not pay it or an overdraft transaction if we do pay it. You will be charged an NSF or overdraft fee according to our NSF or overdraft fee policy. You will be charged the fee even if you would have had sufficient funds in your account if the amount of the hold had been equal to the amount of your purchase.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how this can occur &#8211; assume for this example the following: (1) you have opted-in to our overdraft services for the payment of overdrafts on ATM and everyday debit card transactions, (2) we pay the overdraft, and (3) our overdraft fee is $35 per overdraft, but we do not charge the overdraft fee if the transaction overdraws the account by less than $10.</p>
<p>You have $120 in your account. You swipe your card at the card reader on a gasoline pump. Since it is unclear what the final bill will be, the gas station&#8217;s processing system immediately requests a hold on your account in a specified amount, for example, $80. Our processing system authorizes a temporary hold on your account in the amount of $80, and the gas station&#8217;s processing system authorizes you to begin pumping gas. You fill your tank and the amount of gasoline you purchased is only $50. Our processing system shows that you have $40 in your account available for other transactions ($120 &#8211; $80 = $40) even though you would have $70 in your account available for other transactions if the amount of the temporary hold was equal to the amount of your purchase ($120 &#8211; $50 = $70). Later, another transaction you have authorized is presented for payment from your account in the amount of $60 (this could be a check you have written, another debit card transaction, an ACH debit or any other kind of payment request). This other transaction is presented before the amount of the temporary hold is adjusted to the amount of your purchase (remember, it may take up to three days for the adjustment to be made). Because the amount of this other transaction is greater than the amount our processing system shows is available in your account, our payment of this transaction will result in an overdraft transaction. Because the transaction overdraws your account by $20, your account will be assessed the overdraft fee of $35 according to our overdraft fee policy. You will be charged this $35 fee according to our policy even though you would have had enough money in your account to cover the $60 transaction if your account had only been debited the amount of your purchase rather than the amount of the temporary hold or if the temporary hold had already been adjusted to the actual amount of your purchase.</p>
<p>Overdrafts. You understand that we may, at our discretion, honor withdrawal requests that overdraw your account. However, the fact that we may honor withdrawal requests that overdraw the account balance does not obligate us to do so later. So you can NOT rely on us to pay overdrafts on your account regardless of how frequently or under what circumstances we have paid overdrafts on your account in the past. We can change our practice of paying overdrafts on your account without notice to you. You can ask us if we have other account services that might be available to you where we commit to paying overdrafts under certain circumstances, such as an overdraft protection line-of-credit or a plan to sweep funds from another account you have with us. You agree that we may charge fees for overdrafts. For consumer accounts, we will not charge fees for overdrafts caused by ATM withdrawals or one-time debit card transactions if you have not opted-in to that service. We may use subsequent deposits, including direct deposits of social security or other government benefits, to cover such overdrafts and overdraft fees.</p>
<p>Multiple Signatures, Electronic Check Conversion, and Similar Transactions. An electronic check conversion transaction is a transaction where a check or similar item is converted into an electronic fund transfer as defined in the Electronic Fund Transfers regulation. In these types of transactions the check or similar item is either removed from circulation (truncated) or given back to you. As a result, we have no opportunity to review the check to examine the signatures on the item. You agree that, as to these or any items as to which we have no opportunity to examine the signatures, you waive any requirement of multiple signatures.</p>
<p>Notice of Withdrawal. We reserve the right to require not less than 7 days&#8217; notice in writing before each withdrawal from an interest-bearing account other than a time deposit or demand deposit, or from any other savings account as defined by Regulation D. (The law requires us to reserve this right, but it is not our general policy to use it.) Withdrawals from a time account prior to maturity or prior to any notice period may be restricted and may be subject to penalty. See your notice of penalty for early withdrawal.</p></div>

<div class="toggle_container" style="display:none;">
<div class="block">
<p>Stop Payments. Unless otherwise provided, the rules in this section cover stopping payment of items such as checks and drafts. Rules for stopping payment of other types of transfers of funds, such as consumer electronic fund transfers, may be established by law or our policy. If we have not disclosed these rules to you elsewhere, you may ask us about those rules.</p>
<p>We may accept an order to stop payment on any item from any one of you. You must make any stop-payment order in the manner required by law and we must receive it in time to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on it before our stop-payment cutoff time. Because stop-payment orders are handled by computers, to be effective, your stop-payment order must precisely identify the number, date, and amount of the item, and the payee.</p>
<p>You may stop payment on any item drawn on your account whether you sign the item or not. Generally, if your stop-payment order is given to us in writing it is effective for six months. Your order will lapse after that time if you do not renew the order in writing before the end of the six-month period. If the original stop-payment order was oral your stop-payment order will lapse after 14 calendar days if you do not confirm your order in writing within that time period. We are not obligated to notify you when a stop-payment order expires. A release of the stop-payment request may be made only by the person who initiated the stop-payment order.</p>
<p>If you stop payment on an item and we incur any damages or expenses because of the stop payment, you agree to indemnify us for those damages or expenses, including attorneys&#8217; fees. You assign to us all rights against the payee or any other holder of the item. You agree to cooperate with us in any legal actions that we may take against such persons. You should be aware that anyone holding the item may be entitled to enforce payment against you despite the stop-payment order.</p>
<p>Our stop-payment cutoff time is one hour after the opening of the next banking day after the banking day on which we receive the item. Additional limitations on our obligation to stop payment are provided by law (e.g., we paid the item in cash or we certified the item).</p></div>

<p>Statements. Your Duty to Report Unauthorized Signatures, Alterations, and Forgeries.

This 60-day limitation is without regard to whether we used ordinary care. The limitation in this paragraph is in addition to that contained in the first paragraph of this section.</p>
<p>Your Duty to Report Other Errors. In addition to your duty to review your statements for unauthorized signatures, alterations and forgeries, you agree to examine your statement with reasonable promptness for any other error &#8211; such as an encoding error. In addition, if you receive or we make available either your items or images of your items, you must examine them for any unauthorized or missing endorsements or any other problems. You agree that the time you have to examine your statement and items and report to us will depend on the circumstances. However, this time period shall not exceed 60 days. Failure to examine your statement and items and report any errors to us within 60 days of when we first send or make the statement available precludes you from asserting a claim against us for any errors on items identified in that statement and as between you and us the loss will be entirely yours.</p>

<div class="toggle_container" style="display:none;">
<div class="block">
<p>Remotely Created Checks. Like any standard check or draft, a remotely created check (sometimes called a telecheck, preauthorized draft or demand draft) is a check draft that can be used to withdraw money from an account. Unlike a typical check or draft, however, a remotely created check is not issued by the paying bank and does not contain the signature of the account owner (or a signature purported to be the signature of the account owner). In place of a signature, the check usually has a statement that the owner authorized the check or has the owner&#8217;s name typed or printed on the signature line.</p>
<p>You warrant and agree to the following for every remotely created check we receive from you for deposit or collection: (1) you have received express and verifiable authorization to create the check in the amount and to the payee that appears on the check; (2) you will maintain proof of the authorization for at least 2 years from the date of the authorization, and supply us the proof if we ask; and (3) if a check is returned you owe us the amount of the check, regardless of when the check is returned. We may take funds from your account to pay the amount you owe us, and if there are insufficient funds in your account, you still owe us the remaining balance.</p></div>

Endorsements must be made in blue or black ink, so that they are readable by automated check processing equipment.<br />
As you look at the front of a check, the &#8220;trailing edge&#8221; is the left edge. When you flip the check over, be sure to keep all endorsement information within 1 1/2&#8243; of that edge.</p>
