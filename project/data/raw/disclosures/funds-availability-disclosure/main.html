        <h3>Your Ability to Withdraw Funds at MainStreet Bank</h3>
<p>Our policy is to make funds from your cash and checking deposits available to you on the first business day after the day we receive your deposit. Electronic direct deposits will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Once the funds are available, you can withdraw the funds in cash and we will use the funds to pay checks that you have written.</p>
<p>For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day except Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays. If you make a deposit before 5:00 p.m. on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after 5:00 p.m. or on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day we are open.</p>
<p><strong>Longer Delays May Apply</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, we will make all of the funds that you deposit by check available to you on the first business day after the day of your deposit. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. The first $200 of your deposit, however, may be available on the first business day.</p>
<p>If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available on the first business day, we will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If you deposit is not made directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice the day after we received your deposit.</p>
<p>If you will need the funds from the deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available.</p>
<p>Funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>We believe a check you deposit will not be paid</li>
<li>You deposit checks totaling more than $5,000 on any one day</li>
<li>You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid</li>
<li>You have overdrawn your account repeatedly in the last size months</li>
<li>There is an emergency, such as failure of computer or communications equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. They will generally be available not later than the fifth business day after the day of your deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Holds on Other Funds</strong></p>
<p>If we accept for deposit a check that is drawn to another bank, we may, make funds from the deposit available for withdrawl immediately, but delay your availabilty to withdraw funds in another account of the customer. The funds in the other account will be available within the time periods that are described elsewhere in this Policy for the type of the check that the customer has deposited.</p>
<p><strong>Special Rules for New Accounts</strong></p>
<p>If you are a new customer, the following special rules may apply during the first 30 days your account is open.</p>
<p>Funds from electronic deposits to your account will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Funds from deposits of cash, wire transfers and the first $5,000 of a day&#8217;s total deposits of cashier&#8217;s, certified, teller&#8217;s, traveler&#8217;s and federal, state, and local government checks will be available on the first business day after the day of your deposit if the deposit meets certain conditions. For example, the checks must be payable to you (and you may have to use a special deposit slip). The excess over $5,000 will be available on the ninth business day after the day of your deposit. If you deposit of these checks (other than a U.S. Treasury check) is not made in person to one of our employees, the first $5,000 will not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit.</p>
<p>Funds from all other check deposits will be available on the fifth business day after the day of your deposit.</p>
