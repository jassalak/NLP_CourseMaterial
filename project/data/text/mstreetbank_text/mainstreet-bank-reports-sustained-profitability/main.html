“Loan quality was a significant focus in 2012. The effects of the economy caught up to a few of our borrowers at the end of 2011 – which increased our nonperforming numbers,” reported Chairman, CEO and President Jeff W. Dick. “After a year of concerted efforts working with our borrowers and in a few cases writing down assets, I am happy to report that our asset quality is once again strong. Nonperforming loans now represent a nominal one-third of one percent of our loan portfolio.”
The Bank originated $65 million in new commercial loans this year, with gross loans ending the year at $215 million. The bank’s balance sheet reflects total assets at $271 million. Total deposits are at $241 million and the bank remains well capitalized. The year-end book value per share is $9.73. The share price on December 31, 2012 closed at 60% of book value, or $5.80.
