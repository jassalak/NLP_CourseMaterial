Veterans Day Deals
On November 11, 2011 Americans will honor those who served in the U.S. military. Veterans Day, formally Armistice Day is the dedication to American veterans of all wars. On behalf of airbanking, we’d like to take this moment to thank all of our veterans and active duty military for their service and sacrifice.
In the spirit of giving thanks, we came across online resources that featured restaurants giving free meals and great deals for Veterans on Veterans Day. We’d like to share these with you to help you celebrate your Veterans Day.
Be sure to check with each restaurant to learn more about each deal, as some may only be valid at select locations. And bring your military ID or proof of service with you. Just about all of these require one or the other. We hope you enjoy your Veterans Day and take advantage of one of these great offers*…
