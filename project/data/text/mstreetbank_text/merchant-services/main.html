Attention Merchants- Every merchant who stores, transmits or processes cardholder information is required to maintain compliance with the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). In support of this important industry mandate, MainStreet Bank requires all merchants to validate their PCI DSS compliance status with us. This validation must be done on an annual basis. As your processor, we have simplified the effort that you must undertake to validate your compliance. If you haven't already submitted your validation, please click on the link https://www.pciapply.com/pci_fihd_login.aspx to begin the process. Failure to do so may result in significant fees and fines. If you have questions or need further assistance please contact the PCI Compliance Helpdesk at (877) 277-1178 or by e-mail at asvteam@pcihelpcenter.com.
