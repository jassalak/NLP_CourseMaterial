MainStreet Bank Continues Record Performance
“We had a great year all-around,” said Chairman, CEO and President Jeff W. Dick. “Our loan portfolio and our deposit base each grew by 20%. Along with record earnings, we raised new capital and we added depth to the lending and deposit teams – the results of which will support future growth for the Bank.”
“The market responded very favorably to our capital raise prior to year-end. Existing shareholders, customers and institutional investors significantly oversubscribed to the offering, which was contained at the $12.75 million original amount. Subsequent to the offering, the share price has traded up 5%,” said Dick.
The Bank reports total assets of $345 million, gross loans of $272 million and total deposits of $302 million. The Bank remains very well capitalized and loan quality remains extremely strong.
MainStreet Bank recently released an iPad App to complement its mobile App for iPhones and Androids. Additionally, MainStreet Bank released Aircharity® in 2012.

MainStreet Bank was the first community bank in the Washington, DC Metropolitan area to offer a full online business banking solution.
