You can view your payoff balance by logging in to your Online Banking. Click on your Auto Loan account then click on “Account Info”. This webpage will provide you your pay-off amount as well as how to calculate your payoff amount if you will be mailing in a check to pay off your auto loan. You can also call us at 703-481-4545, and we can provide your payoff balance over the phone.
The principal balance does not include the interest that is due to pay off your auto loan. Your payoff amount is how much you must pay to satisfy the terms of your loan and payoff your debt today. Your payoff amount may also include any fees, such as late fees, that have been assessed to your account.
Paying the principal balance will leave a remaining balance that will need to be paid prior to the release of your title. In order to pay off your auto loan you will need to pay off the principal balance, the interest and any fees due at the time of your payoff payment. Please add ten (10) days additional interest to the payoff amount to allow time for the payment to arrive and to process your payoff request. Any over payment will be refunded back to you.
To view if we have received your payment you can view your auto loan account details by setting up your MainStreet Bank online banking. Your payments will be credited to your account the day we receive your payment. The payment will show on your account within your online banking 1-2 business days after we receive your payment.
Go to our auto loans webpage and click on the “Enroll in Online Banking” button to set up your MainStreet Bank online banking. You will receive online banking access within 3-5 business days.
Each state has its own title process. As a general rule, MainStreet Bank will release your vehicle title ten (10) business days after payoff is received. This is to allow your payment time for successful processing.
If you have a new address please be sure to notify us so we can mail your payoff notification and title to the correct address. If you do not notify us your payoff notification and title will be mailed to the most recent address we have on file.
