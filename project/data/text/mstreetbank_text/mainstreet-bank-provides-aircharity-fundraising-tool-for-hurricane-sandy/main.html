Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTC Bulletin Board: MNSB) established an aircharity® account to collect donations to help communities rebuild from the brutal devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy. MainStreet Bank has agreed to waive all fees for donations received through credit card or electronic check to ensure that 100% of each donation reaches the American Red Cross. To donate online, visit airbanking.com/SandyReliefFund.
Aircharity® is a one-of-a-kind donation portal custom-built and hosted by MainStreet Bank, a community bank in Northern Virginia. Chairman, CEO & President Jeff W. Dick stated that, “We feel it is critical that 100% of the proceeds go toward Hurricane relief, so MainStreet Bank is absorbing all of the normal processing fees.
Aircharity® provides a unique donation “widget” that tells each charity’s compelling story, rather than just a “donate” button. Aircharity® encourages social sharing once the donation is complete. And, aircharity® doesn’t tempt a donor with the ability to donate to other causes. To learn more about aircharity®, visit airbanking.com/aircharity.
