Making The Most Of Your Memorial Day
It’s almost Memorial Day… a holiday often celebrated by cook outs, fireworks, travel to warm beachy areas, sun tanning, and that ever so important extra day off. But no matter how you decide to spend this summer kick off weekend, be prepared so you can plan ahead to save money during the holiday weekend.
Here are a few ideas of things to do that can save you money:
Organize a family or neighborhood cook out. Who doesn’t like good ol’ fashion pot luck? Get a few neighbors or contact family in the area and have everyone get together and bring a personal recipe to the event. This will help those who want to have a cook out that weekend but not have to spend for all the food, drinks, condiments, etc.
Use sites like Priceline.com and JetBlue.com to find deals and specials for Memorial Day. Some of these deals include discounts on car rentals, hotels, along with airfare. Be a savvy shopper and find the deals, they’re out there!
Research local historic sites. Many historical areas have fairs, concerts, and parades on Memorial Day. Bring water containers to fill up at water fountains if you can. If not, then at least you can save money on food by packing your own picnic basket. Turn it into a nice outing with the family or something new and different with that special someone.
If you have ideas of your own, let us know. And don’t forget to take a moment to celebrate this holiday and give thanks to those who have served and continue to serve in our armed forces. From all of us at airbanking, have a Happy Memorial Day!
