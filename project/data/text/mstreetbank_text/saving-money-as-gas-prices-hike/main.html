Saving Money As Gas Prices Hike
As Spring and Summer months approach it’s not uncommon for gas prices to start marching upward. But this year, due to Middle East unrest and reduced oil drilling in the Gulf, that march has turned into a mad dash.
According to AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge Report1, gas prices have climbed from about $3.07 a gallon for Regular on January 1, to presently $3.553 for Regular. That is a $.48 jump with the majority of the spike happening over the last 3 weeks.
So I figured this would be a good time to refresh ourselves on some gas saving tips. I spent time looking around at different tips and here are my favorites:
1.Maintain a steady speed
From The Hour blog2: The writer recommends to “Drive Sensibly”, basically stating that by slowing down to the speed limit and reducing the accelerating and breaking, your car can become 33% more fuel efficient.
2. Shop around online for gas prices
Almost all articles I’ve read have said to shop online at sites like gaspricewatch.com and AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge for gas prices. But I’d like to make a point, be sure to stay within your driving area. It doesn’t help for you to drive 10 minutes out of the way to save 5 cents a gallon, but you might just find some good local savings too, so happy searching!
3. Know your traveling expenses
I love the AAA “Your Driving Costs” calculations3. It will help you break down all the expenses of the automobile and see how much it is per mile. Great for those looking to buy a new or used car.
4. Maintain your car
If you’re not doing the maintenance on your car or checking your tire pressure regularly, you are blowing money out your tailpipe. Like any piece of machinery, your car performs better with proper maintenance (have you ever tried to move something on wheels when one of the wheels are flat, ITS HARD!) Keep this in mind when you see that one of your tires is running a little flat.
These four were the ones I like the most, but there are tons more. Obviously carpooling helps save on gas as well, as does riding your bike or taking public transit (and I recommend doing all of the above).
If you know or find more tips, add them. Here’s hoping we’ll see a retreat in gas prices in the near future, but until then drive safe and drive smart!
