MainStreet Bank Reports Excellent Balance Sheet Growth
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) reported balance sheet growth of 49% through the nine months ending September 30, 2015 with total assets of $481 million against total assets of $322 million at the same period in 2014. The Bank completed an $80 million indirect consumer loan portfolio purchase on July 27, 2015.
Net income is down slightly for the third quarter of 2015 due to the anticipated loan loss provision necessary to book the indirect consumer loan portfolio purchase. The Bank reported net income for the quarter of $353 thousand against the prior quarter net income of $406 thousand, a 13% decline. The loan loss provision for the third quarter totaled $775 thousand.
Year-to-date net income through September 30, 2015 of $1.224 million is up five percent from the same period last year. Fully diluted earnings per share through September 30th were 29 cents as compared with 43 cents for the same period in 2014. However, the weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1,531,372 between the two periods, largely due to a capital raise that occurred at the end of 2014.
Net interest income increased by $2.39 million during the nine months ending September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Net interest income totaled $11.26 million during the period, representing a net interest margin of 4.03%.
Loans outstanding increased by $120.23 million during the nine months ending September 30, 2015, from $269.1 million on Dec. 31, 2014 to $389.2 million on September 30, 2015.
Total deposits increased by $86.1 million during the nine months ending September 30, 2015 reaching $388.4 million. Total deposits increased by $100 million, or 34.68%, since the same period in 2014. Year-over-year demand account balances increased by $23.6 million while money market and interest checking accounts increased by $20.5 million, increases of 48.1% and 27.3% respectively. Time deposits increased by $55.9 million, or 34%, during the same period. The increased deposit growth was used to fund liquidity and the indirect consumer loan portfolio purchase. An additional source of funding for the portfolio was Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which increased $44.3 million year over year.
Asset quality remains very strong. Nonperforming loans were 0.21 percent of total loans on September 30, 2015. As a comparison, the average for the 1,239 banks in MainStreet’s national peer group is 0.98% as of June 30, 2015.
For the nine months ending September 30, 2015, non-interest income was $1 million, compared to $831 thousand for the same period in 2014. Non-interest expense for the nine months ending September 30, 2015 was $9.08 million, compared to $7.54 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was driven primarily by personnel related expenses associated with the growth and expansion during 2014, which allowed the company to experience high quality growth.
QUOTES: “The purchase of the $80 million indirect consumer loan portfolio in late July has been a great opportunity for MainStreet, essentially kick-starting the portfolio for the team we acquired late in 2014. That acquisition, in addition to the good growth we continue to experience in the commercial loan portfolio, is the primary reason for our continued high quality performance,” says Jeff W. Dick, Chairman, CEO and President of MainStreet Bank. “As of the nine months ending September 30, 2015, we were trading at approximately 118.5% of book value, and our plan for continued growth should result in building strong shareholder value.”
