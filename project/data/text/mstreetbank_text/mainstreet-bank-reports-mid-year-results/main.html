MainStreet Bank Reports Mid-Year Results
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) ended the first half of 2014 with pre-tax earnings of $817,000 and nearly $316 million in total assets.
“Our loan portfolio has grown nearly 12% since this time last year,” said Chairman, CEO & President Jeff W. Dick. “And our deposit base has grown over 21% during that same time period. Probably the most gratifying metric for us is the continued high quality of our loan portfolio. A close second to that factor is the progress we’ve made to contain costs and improve the overall efficiency of our organization.”
The Bank reports total assets of $315.9 million, gross loans of $249.9 million and total deposits of $288.2 million. The Bank remains very well capitalized.
