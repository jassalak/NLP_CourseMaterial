MainStreet Bank is Founding Partner of Arlington Community Radio
Fairfax, VA: MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) in the truest sense of community banking has become a founding partner of Arlington’s community radio station WERA 96.7 FM. The radio station can also be heard over the internet and is the only Arlington community radio station with programming created by and for the members of the local community. WERA is part of Arlington Independent Media (AIM).
The station originates from the AIM facility in Clarendon with programming gathered from many sources all over the County. Middle school and high school students and teachers; senior citizens and business leaders; non-profit and service agency boards; staffs and volunteers; artists, performers and critics; journalists and documentarians – these are just a few of the members of the Arlington community who will be producing programs for WERA.
“We are excited for the chance to support such an impactful initiative,” said Chairman, CEO and President Jeff W. Dick. “MainStreet has had a relationship with Arlington Independent Media for several years, and we look forward to the long and continued success of WERA 96.7 FM.”
