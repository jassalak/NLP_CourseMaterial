MainStreet Bank Reports Profitable 3rd Quarter
“The Bank originated $54 million in small business loans this year, which is really a considerable
accomplishment given the generally low loan demand associated with our current economy,” reports
Chairman and CEO Jeff W. Dick. “There are many lenders out looking at relatively few deals in the
marketplace. Fortunately, our experienced commercial lenders offer a significant competitive edge in the
small business lending arena.”
The bank’s balance sheet reflects total assets at $251 million. Gross loans are at $211 million, total
deposits are at $221 million. The bank remains well capitalized and asset quality is again strong. The
current book value per share is $9.57. The share price on September 30th closed at 47% of book value, or
$4.50.
