The longer version is we want to see what extraordinary places or things you enjoy. Photos can be similar to those on our homepage … exploring the open and beautiful sites of one of nation’s national parks. Or, maybe your little slice of joy is on a beautiful beach or peaceful dock on a lake.
Whatever or wherever the thing or place is that gives you that feeling of bliss, we want to see it. I personally lean towards the idea of the beautiful beach, but that’s where I love to be…
Once you’ve loaded your photo, share it and get your friends to vote for your picture. Promote your picture and you might earn yourself a spot in the top 25 with the most votes.
From there the winner and 2 runner-ups will be determined by our panel of judges. The top prize is a $500 VISA gift card with a $250 VISA gift card given to the first runner up and a $150 VISA gift card given to the second runner up.
It’s an easy contest to join and even easier to put yourself into the final round of the judges pick. If you have any questions, check out our Enjoy Life Photo Contest and the contest rules.
I look forward to seeing your Enjoy Life Contest photo and I wish you good luck!
