MainStreet Bank Reports Another Record Year
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) reported a 39% increase in its share trading price for 2015 with an average daily volume of 3,550 shares traded. The Bank’s stock started the year at $8.90 per share and ended at $12.35 per share.
MainStreet’s annual balance sheet growth was 39% for calendar year 2015 with total assets of $478 million against total assets of $345 million at the start of the year. The Bank completed an $80 million indirect consumer loan portfolio purchase on July 27, 2015.
Net income after tax for the year is up 24% even with the one-time $775 thousand loss provision that was necessary to book the indirect consumer loan portfolio purchase. The Bank reported net income for the fourth quarter of $946 thousand against the prior year’s fourth quarter net income of $588 thousand, a 61% increase.
Fully diluted earnings per share through December 31, 2015 were 51 cents as compared with 64 cents for the same period in 2014. However, the weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1,504,401 between the two periods, largely due to a capital raise that occurred at the end of 2014.
Net interest income of $15.645 million reported for December 31, 2015 improved $3.474 million over net interest income from December 31, 2014. The net interest margin fell slightly to 3.96%, largely due to the indirect consumer loan portfolio, which is a lower-yielding short-term asset.
Net loans outstanding increased by $129 million during the twelve months ending December 31, 2015, from $269 million on Dec. 31, 2014 to $398 million on December 31, 2015.
Total deposits increased by $83 million during the twelve months ending December 31, 2015 reaching $386 million. Year-over-year demand account balances increased by $17 million while money market and interest checking accounts increased by $29 million, increases of 33% and 43% respectively. Time deposits increased by $37 million, or 20%, during the same period. The increased deposit growth was used to fund liquidity and the indirect consumer loan portfolio purchase. An additional source of funding for the portfolio was Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which increased $48 million year over year.
Asset quality remains very strong. Nonperforming loans were 0.17 percent of total loans on December 31, 2015.
Non-interest income was $1.265 million for the twelve months ending December 31, 2015 compared to $1.017 million for the same period in 2014. Non-interest expense for the twelve months ending December 31, 2015 was $12.346 million, compared to $10.097 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was driven primarily by personnel related expenses associated with the growth and expansion during 2015, which allowed the company to experience high quality growth.
