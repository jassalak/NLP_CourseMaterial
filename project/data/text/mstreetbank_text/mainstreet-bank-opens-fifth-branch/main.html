MainStreet Bank Opens Fifth Branch – 2nd Quarter
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTC Bulletin Board: MNSB) opened its fifth branch on August 13, 2012. In a simultaneous event, the bank relocated its headquarters from Herndon to Fairfax.
The new location, 10089 Fairfax Boulevard, Fairfax, Virginia, hosts a full service branch along with the business development and lending teams. In addition, the corporate offices relocated to the new facility. Although the headquarters moved from Herndon, the original bank branch remains intact. “Our roots are very deep in Herndon, and we will continue to remain very active in the community,” stated Chairman, President & CEO Jeff W. Dick. “We had an opportunity to purchase a larger property in Fairfax back in June 2010 that was just too good to pass up.”
MainStreet Bank reported a loss of $315 thousand for the first six months of 2012. The loss was an
anomaly for the bank, which had ridden through the entire recent recession with positive earnings. The
loss is the result of charge-offs that were associated with two commercial loans. In spite of the recent
charge-offs, the bank anticipates a profitable year-end. The current book value per share is $9.48. The
share price on June 30th closed at 49% of book value, or $4.65.
The bank’s balance sheet reflects total assets at $250 million. Gross loans are at $201 million, total
deposits are at $225 million and the bank remains well capitalized. MainStreet Bank recently introduced a new account called aircharity®. aircharity® is a complete fundraising solution for organized charities as well as groups and individuals who are raising money for any cause.
