Tech-Savvy Banks Plan Out Their Strategic It Objectives In Advance
Every month Jeff Dick carves time out of his busy schedule to sit down to talk technology with his community bank’s chief financial officer, head of operations and two IT gurus. This informal “technology committee” is a critical part of the overall technology plan for MainStreet Bank in Herndon, Va., and they discuss everything from phone systems to computer purchases to tech spending. They prioritize their resources along the way to come up with an overall vision that gels with the $254 million-asset institution’s overall strategic plan.
