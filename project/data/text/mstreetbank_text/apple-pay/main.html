With Apple Pay, your personal, transaction and card information is kept private. Apple creates a unique device number, Device Account Number, when you set up Apple Pay on your mobile device. This code is sent to the merchant, along with a transaction-specific dynamic security code, with additional information to complete the transaction. Apple Pay does not track your transaction information that can be tied back to you.

Additional Questions?
A - If your MainStreet Bank or Airbanking debit or credit card is already on-file with Apple (iTunes), you will be offered an option to use it as your default account for Apple Pay. You have the option to add other MainStreet Bank accounts and will be prompted for a one-time entry of a few account details such as name, address, card number, expiration date, and the three digit card verification value that can be found on the back of your card. MainStreet Bank, Visa, and Apple will work behind the scenes to create a digital version of your account and enable you to start making payments with Apple Pay.
Q - When can I use the new Apple device payment feature?
A - You can use Apple Pay as soon as your MainStreet Bank or Airbanking debit/credit card has been activated.
Q - What is a digital account number and why should I care?
A - Your payment card information, such as the 16-digit account number found on the front of your card, will be replaced with a digital account number that can be securely stored on Apple devices and used to make purchases. Your credit and debit card numbers are NOT stored on the device, or on Apple servers. This helps to reduce the potential for fraud.
The process is invisible to you and happens behind the scenes. It also helps to simplify checkout by eliminating the need to enter and re-enter your account number when buying items in mobile applications “in-app” or at the point-of-sale.
Q - On which devices / phones / tablets / computers will this work?
A - Apple Pay will work with iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch. Within mobile applications, Apple Pay is compatible with iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, and iPad Mini 3 and 4.
