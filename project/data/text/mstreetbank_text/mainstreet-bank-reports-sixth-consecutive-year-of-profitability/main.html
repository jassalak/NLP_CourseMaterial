MainStreet Bank Reports Sixth Consecutive Year of Profitability
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) reported another profitable year with record net income of just over $1 million. The Bank’s book value per share continues to rise, totaling $9.99 as of December 31, 2013. The closing share price as of December 31, 2013 was $8.10, which was up over 52% from the December 31, 2012 closing share price.
“The bank has been profitable seven out of the ten calendar years we’ve reported earnings,” stated Chairman, CEO & President Jeff W. Dick. “By my book, that’s pretty decent performance – given the severity of the global recession that we endured. Our success continues to be influenced by economic conditions, which of late have been on a slow and steady course of recovery.”
The Bank reports total assets of $277.3 million, gross loans of $226.2 million and total deposits of $250.3 million. The Bank remains very well capitalized.
