MainStreet Sets Course for Growth with $12.75 million Capital Raise
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) announces a successful $12.75 million capital raise through the issuance of common stock.
“We were pleased that the offering was significantly oversubscribed. Investors clearly understand that the Washington, DC metropolitan area is a great place to do business and that MainStreet Bank is well positioned in the marketplace. We believe that we have a great opportunity for growth ahead of us,” said MainStreet Bank Chairman, CEO and President Jeff W. Dick.
The additional capital substantially increases the overall lending capacity of the Bank as it serves small and medium-sized businesses, professionals, and consumers in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
FIG Partners LLC, an employee-owned broker/dealer based in Atlanta Georgia, assisted in raising the new capital from existing shareholders, as well as local and institutional investors. Greg Gersack, Managing Principal, and Matthew Veneri, Managing Principal, who both Co-Head the Investment Banking group at FIG, managed the transaction for FIG Partners.
MainStreet operates five branches in Herndon, Fairfax, Fairfax City, McLean and Clarendon. In addition, MainStreet has 55,000 free ATMs and an online banking solution called “airbanking®”.

With robust and easy-to-use online business banking technology, MainStreet has literally “put our bank” in well over 750 businesses in the Metropolitan area and across the United States.
MainStreet Bank was the first community bank in the Washington, DC metropolitan area to offer a full online business banking solution.
