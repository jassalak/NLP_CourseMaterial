MainStreet Bancshares Reports First Quarter Performance
Fairfax, VA — MainStreet Bancshares (OTCQB: MNSB), the holding company for MainStreet Bank, reports net income of $1.03 million for the first quarter of 2017, which is 18% higher than first quarter 2016 net income of $914 thousand. Note: first quarter 2017 numbers include $241 thousand of interest expense for newly issued subordinated debt. Earnings per share for the first quarter 2017 were $0.24 versus $0.22 for first quarter 2016.
Net interest income of $4.7 million for first quarter 2017 improved $262 thousand over net interest income for first quarter 2016. The first quarter 2017 net interest margin is 3.75% compared with 3.84% for the first quarter of 2016.
Non-interest income is up 200% for first quarter 2017 versus 2016. Non-interest income (no securities gains) is $647 thousand in 2017 compared to $216 thousand (net of securities gains) for 2016. This increase is attributable to the new payment systems group, increased fee income on deposit accounts and income attributable to bank-owned life insurance.
Non-interest expense for first quarter 2017 is $3.7 million compared to $3.3 million for first quarter 2016. This is primarily due to an increase in employees and salaries in support of balance sheet growth. The efficiency ratio held steady at 69% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 70% for first quarter 2016.
The Company’s March 31, 2017 balance sheet experienced a temporary decline of 1.29% from year-end totals. MainStreet President Chris Brockett indicated that, “this is not indicative of expected future performance as MainStreet anticipates good growth year-on-year. The loans-in-process pipeline is currently very robust and balance sheet metrics should be back on-track at the time of second quarter reporting.” Asset quality is strong, as non-performing loans represent an infinitesimal two basis points of total gross loans on March 31, 2017.
Total deposits as of March 31, 2017 were $464 million. Non-interest deposits represent 25% of total deposits.
The book value per common share is $11.09 as of March 31, 2017. According to OTC Markets, the share price closed on March 31, 2017 at $16.55 per common share, or 149% of book value. During the first quarter there were 328 trades for a total volume of 309,699 common shares totaling $5.1 million.
“We have a good year of growth and opportunity in front of us.” says Jeff W. Dick, Chairman and CEO of MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. and MainStreet Bank. “Our earnings are strong and the local market is robust. Two well-respected local community banks were recently acquired by larger institutions, which provides opportunities for MainStreet for new customers as well as new employees who prefer the local community bank model.”
