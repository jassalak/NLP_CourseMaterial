MainStreet Bank Reports Record Performance
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) ended the first nine months of 2014 with net income of $1.17 million, almost double the level reported for the first nine months of 2013.
“It feels like small business is back in business,” said Chairman, CEO & President Jeff W. Dick. “New loan opportunities are coming to us at a great pace. Our loan portfolio has grown 16.5% over the same period last year. This solid performance trend is the impetus we need to get our share price trading where it ought to be.” The book value of a share of MainStreet Bank stock is $10.39, and it is currently trading in the $8 range.
The Bank reports total assets of $322 million, gross loans of $256 million and total deposits of $288.4 million. The Bank remains very well capitalized. Loan quality remains very strong.
“I’ve been with this bank since day one,” said Director and Hall of Famer Darrell Green. “The quality of care MainStreet provides to its customer base is phenomenal. At our core, we are a traditional community bank, but the game changer is our technology. This mix of personal service and technology is working well, and you can see by the numbers that we’re really coming into our stride.”
