Additional Questions?
Q - My new Android device has Google Pay. How do I set it up?
A - If your MainStreet Bank or Airbanking debit or credit card is already on-file with Google, you will be offered an option to use it as your default account for Google Pay. You have the option to add other MainStreet Bank accounts and will be prompted for a one-time entry of a few account details such as name, address, card number, expiration date, and the three digit card verification value that can be found on the back of your card. MainStreet Bank, Visa, and Google will work behind the scenes to create a digital version of your account and enable you to start making payments with Google Pay.
Q - When can I use the new Android device payment feature?
A - You can use Google Pay as soon as your MainStreet Bank or Airbanking debit/credit card has been activated.
Q - What is a digital account number and why should I care?

Your credit and debit card numbers are NOT stored on the device, or on Apple servers. This helps to reduce the potential for fraud.
The process is invisible to you and happens behind the scenes. It also helps to simplify checkout by eliminating the need to enter and re-enter your account number when buying items in mobile applications “in-app” or at the point-of-sale.
