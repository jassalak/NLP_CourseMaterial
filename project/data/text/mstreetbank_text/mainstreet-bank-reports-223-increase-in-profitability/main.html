And, while the bank is doing well in these challenging economic times, we remain cautious about the economy as a whole.”
“As a community bank, we only thrive when our customers and communities do the same, so taking care of our customers and looking out for the best interest of our community is ingrained in the way we conduct our business each and every day. And when our customers call us, they’ll be reassured to know that they won’t be talking to someone halfway across the globe. Instead, they will be talking with their community banker who lives and works in the same community they do.”
