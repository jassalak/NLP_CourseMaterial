MainStreet Bank Reports First Quarter Results
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) ended the first quarter of 2014 with just over $304 million in total assets. “We’re celebrating our first decade of community banking this year, and we’re proud to have achieved this growth benchmark,” said Chairman, CEO & President Jeff W. Dick.
“We’ve experienced a great first quarter of loan growth,” Dick continued. “And we are optimistic with what 2014 has in-store for the Bank and for the local economy. Of course the one downside to loan growth is the offsetting need to fund the Allowance. Nevertheless, our loan portfolio is strong and we continue to move forward with an excellent team of commercial lenders. We are poised for growth and excited to pursue every good lending opportunity we can find within our market.”
The Bank reports total assets of $304.4 million, gross loans of $241.3 million and total deposits of $278 million. Net income for the quarter was $68 thousand. The Bank remains very well capitalized.
