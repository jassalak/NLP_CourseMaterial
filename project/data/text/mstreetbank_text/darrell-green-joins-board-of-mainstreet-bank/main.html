Darrell Green Joins Board of MainStreet Bank
Fairfax, VA MainStreet Bank (OTC Bulletin Board: MNSB) announced that NFL Hall of Famer Darrell Green has joined the Board of Directors of MainStreet Bank. Mr. Green was a founding shareholder of the bank with continued strong ties to the institution.
Chairman, CEO and President Jeff W. Dick stated, “We are excited to have Darrell on the Board. He brings such strong credibility and integrity – two attributes that we hold very dear at MainStreet. He is familiar with the management team and several of the Directors, so I really see him hitting the ground running.”
Mr. Green stated, “I first approached Jeff back in 2003 because I liked his community bank story. People who know me know that I have always been very community-minded in my actions and deeds. I’ve appreciated the strong relationship with MainStreet because they stand for everything that is right in community banking. They work with their customers through good times and hard times, and they don’t give up. I think that I can bring value to the table and I look forward to working with the Board and management to continue to build on a solid franchise.”
Green went on to talk briefly about the bank’s newest product – aircharity®, saying; “I recently had cause to open an aircharity® account for a college football friend who had been in a bad car accident. It was so easy to get up and running; and we raised a lot of money for my friend. I also reconnected with many former teammates in the process. I highly recommend aircharity® for any fundraising purpose.”
