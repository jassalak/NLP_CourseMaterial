MainStreet Bank Reports Record First Quarter Performance
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) reported a 97% increase in first quarter 2016 earnings – nearly double the level of first quarter 2015 earnings. The share price closed the quarter at $11.95 with a high of $12.35 during the first quarter and an average daily volume of 3,713 shares. MainStreet was recently awarded the OTCQX Top Performing Bank award.
MainStreet’s first quarter 2016 balance sheet improved 38% from the first quarter of 2015 with total assets of $498 million against total assets of $359 million respectively.
Net interest income of $4.46 million reported for March 31, 2016 improved $911 thousand over net interest income from March 31, 2015. The net interest margin shifted to 3.84% largely due to the indirect consumer loan portfolio, which is a lower-yielding short-term asset play.
Net loans outstanding for the first quarter of 2016 totaled $413 million against net loans outstanding for the first quarter of 2015 of $287 million, an increase of $126 million.
Total deposits as of March 31, 2016 were $403 million; or $86 million over total deposits of $317 million at March 31, 2015. During those same periods, demand account balances increased $16 million and interest checking accounts increased by $21 million. Time deposits increased by $49 million.
Asset quality remains very strong. Nonperforming loans were 0.17 percent of total loans on March 31, 2016.
Non-interest income was $219 thousand for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $211 thousand (net of security gains) for the same period in 2015. Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2016 was $3.3 million, compared to $3 million for the same period in 2015. The increase is primarily in salaries.
QUOTES: “MainStreet ended the quarter just shy of $500 million in total assets, with quality growth metrics in every area. The MainStreet team is producing at strong levels and the balance sheet continues to see good diversification,” says Jeff W. Dick, Chairman, CEO and President of MainStreet Bank. “Earnings are strengthening through the combined efforts of growing earning assets and managing operating expenses.”
