Bank-to-Bank Transfer Service Agreement
Within Online Banking you may separately enroll for the Bank-to-Bank Transfer service (“Service”). This Service allows you to transfer funds between your linked personal deposit accounts at MainStreet Bank and certain deposit accounts at other financial institutions. An inbound transfer moves funds into an account at MainStreet Bank. An outbound transfer moves funds from an account at MainStreet Bank to an account outside of MainStreet Bank. You will need to enroll each of your non-MainStreet Bank accounts that you wish to use for this Service. You agree that you will only attempt to enroll accounts for which you have the authority to transfer funds. All accounts requested to be used as part of this Service will be verified in accordance with MainStreet Bank procedures. The verification process must be completed by you prior to using the Service. You will have 7 days after enrolling an account to complete the verification process. Verification instructions are displayed to you during the enrollment process. If your Service instructions identify the beneficiary or a bank using both a name and a number, we may use the number only to execute your instructions, and are not responsible if the name and the number do not agree. Your obligation to pay the amount of the Bank-to-Bank Transfer to us is not excused in such circumstances.
Checking accounts, savings accounts, Money Market checking and Money Market savings accounts held at a financial institution or credit union in the United States that are able to accept ACH transfers.
Investment and brokerage accounts from other institutions.
Please note: Per government regulation transfers from a Savings or Money Market account to another account or third party by preauthorized, automatic, or telephone transfer – including online banking transfers – are limited to six per month.
If you exceed the transfer limitations set forth in any statement period, your account will be subject to closure by the financial institution and may be subject to an excessive usage fee based on our current fee schedule for every outgoing transfer above the stated limit.
Ineligible Account Types for Transfers:
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
401 K Accounts. • Custodial and/or Trust Accounts.
Certificate of Deposits (CDs) or other time-based accounts.
Loan Accounts (including credit card and equity accounts).
You may have other accounts that are ineligible for the Bank-to-Bank Transfer Service due to restrictions specific to your Financial Institution(s). If in doubt, you must contact the other financial institutions to verify if the accounts are eligible for the Bank-to-Bank Transfer Service. Funds requested to be transferred will be debited/credited to your MainStreet Bank account the business day following the day you initiate the transfer, provided you have met the bank’s cutoff time for submitting Bank-to-Bank transfers. In the case of a future dated or recurring transfer, these time limits will be the business day following the scheduled date of the transfer. The cutoff time for initiating transfers is 4:00 PM EST. Funds requested to be transferred will be debited/credited to the non-MainStreet Bank account according to the receiving bank’s availability and transaction processing schedule.
Request for immediate transfers of funds cannot be cancelled. Future dated and recurring transfers can be canceled on or before 4:00 PM EST on the day prior to the scheduled transfer date. If the transfer status is In Process, Pending, or Processed, you cannot cancel the transfer.
There is a $2.50 per transfer fee for the Service. Fees are subject to change. Transfers are subject to the following limits unless otherwise agreed upon by you and MainStreet Bank:
Five inbound transfers per day not to exceed a total of $1,000
Five outbound transfers per day not to exceed a total of $1,000
The above limits apply to the total of all Bank-to-Bank transfers of a specific type for all accounts enrolled in the Service. We may change your dollar limits and transfer limits at any time.

Notify us at once if you believe another person has improperly obtained your Online Banking password. Also notify us at once if someone has transferred or may transfer money from your Bank deposit account without your permission, or if you suspect any fraudulent activity on your account. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit.)
Consumers: If your Online Banking password has been compromised and you tell us within two (2) business days after you learn of the loss or theft, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Online Banking password without your permission to access a Bank deposit account. If you do NOT tell us within two (2) business days after you learn of the loss or theft, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from taking money without your permission had you told us, you could lose as much as $500. Also, if your statement shows withdrawals, transfers, payments or purchases that you did not make or authorize, please notify us at once. If you do not notify us within sixty (60) days from the date the paper or online statement was sent to you, and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking money if you had told us in time, you may not get back any money lost after the sixty (60) days. If extenuating circumstances, such as a long trip or hospital stay, kept you from telling us, the time periods in this section may be extended.
The liability limits DO NOT APPLY to Business Accounts.

If you identify any errors or discrepancies in your statement or transaction record, or if you need more information about a transaction listed on the statement or transaction record. We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after we have sent the FIRST paper or online statement on which the problem or error appeared. If you notify us verbally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within ten (10) business days.
When you tell us about the problem, please:
Tell us your name and account number •
Describe the error or the transaction you are unsure about, and explain why you believe it is in error or what additional information you need.
Tell us the dollar amount of any suspected error.
For a Bank-to-Bank Transfer, tell us the sending and receiving account numbers, date the Bank-to-Bank Transfer was initiated, and the transfer amount.
For a bill payment, tell us the checking account number used to pay the bill, payee name, date the payment was sent, payment amount, reference number, and payee account number for the payment in question.
We will determine if an error occurred and will tell you the results of our investigation within 10 business days (20 business days if the transfer was to or from an account within 30 days after the first deposit to the account was made) after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days (90 days if the transfer or transaction involved a point-of-sale transaction, a foreign initiated transfer or a transfer to or from an account within 30 days after the first deposit to the account was made) to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your account within 10 business days (20 business days if the transfer was to or from an account within 30 days after the first deposit to the account was made) for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint(s) or questions(s) in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account.
We will tell you the results of our investigation within three (3) business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation. We may revoke any provisional credit provided to you if we find an error did not occur.
If we do not complete a transfer to or from your Bank account on time, or for the correct amount, and/or to or from the account specified according to our Agreement with you, we will be responsible, as applicable, for returning any improperly transferred funds and/or for redirecting any misdirected funds to the proper account, and may be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. For example, we will not be liable:
If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough available funds in your account to make a transfer, Bank-to-Bank Transfer, or bill payment.
If a legal order directs us to prohibit withdrawals from the account.
If your account is closed or if it has been frozen.
If the transfer or bill payment would cause your balance to go over the credit limit for any credit arrangement set up to cover overdrafts.
If you, or anyone you allow, commits any fraud or violates any law or regulation.
If any electronic terminal, telecommunication device or any part of the electronic fund transfer system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer or, in the case of a recurring transfer, at the time such transfer should have occurred.
If you have not provided us with complete and correct payment information, including without limitation the name, address, account number, and payment amount for the payee on a Bill Payment or external Bank-to-Bank Transfer.
If you have not properly followed the instructions for using MainStreet Bank’s Online Banking Center Services, including Bank-to-Bank Transfer and Bill Payment.
If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood, computer system failure or improper transmission or handling of payments by a third party) prevent the transfer or bill payment, despite reasonable precautions taken by us. There may be other exceptions not specifically mentioned here.
We are not responsible for any Internet access, Internet Service Provider, financial software or other product or service relating to your computer or the World Wide Web or your telephone or telephone service.

You further agree to notify us immediately and select a new password if you believe that your password may have become known to an unauthorized person.
If we fail or delay in making a transfer pursuant to your instructions, or if we make a transfer in an erroneous amount which is less than the amount per your instructions, unless otherwise required by applicable law our liability shall be limited to interest on the amount which we failed to timely transfer, calculated from the date on which the transfer was to be made until the date it was actually made or you canceled the instructions. We may pay such interest either to you or the intended recipient of the transfer, but in no event will we be liable to both parties, and our payment to either party will fully discharge any obligation to the other. If we make a payment or transfer in an erroneous amount which exceeds the amount per your instructions, or if we permit an unauthorized transfer after we have had a reasonable time to act on a notice from you of possible unauthorized use as described above, unless otherwise required by law our liability will be limited to a refund of the amount erroneously transferred, plus interest thereon from the date of the transfer to the date of the refund, but in no event to exceed 60 days’ interest. If we become liable to you for interest compensation under this Agreement or applicable law, such interest shall be calculated based on the average federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve Bank in the district where the Bank is headquartered for each day interest is due, computed on the basis of a 360-day year.
