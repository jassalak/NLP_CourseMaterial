The Deposit Account Agreement is expressly incorporated herein by reference. The terms and conditions of the Online Service shall control over any inconsistent terms and conditions of the Deposit Account Agreement. The Customer acknowledges that it has signed and executed all agreements, resolutions, signature cards and forms governing the Customer’s deposit account(s) required by the Bank. If the Customer has not signed the foregoing forms required by the Bank, by accepting these Online Service Terms and Conditions, the Customer acknowledges that it has read the contents of and agrees to be bound by the terms of those forms, agreements and documents, and adopts and ratifies, as an authorized signatory(s), the signature(s) of any person(s) who has signed a signature card or any check on the Customer’s account.
1.3 Data and Information Supplied by The Customer.
The Customer shall have the sole responsibility of ensuring the accuracy and correctness of the data transmitted. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Bank shall not examine the data for correctness and the Bank shall not have any responsibility for detecting errors in the data transmitted by the Customer. The data transmitted by the Customer must be legible, correct and complete. The Bank shall not process, and the Bank shall not be liable to the Customer for failure to process, the data if it is not in the format specified by the Bank or if the data is incomplete. The Bank shall not be liable for errors or omissions caused by data that is rejected as the result of the Customer’s failure to provide the data in accordance with the standards specified in the Service terms and conditions and the Operating Instructions.
1.4 Update Notice.
The Customer shall provide written notice to the Bank of any changes to the information previously provided by the Customer to the Bank, including, but not limited to, any additional locations, any change in business, any new business, the identity of principals and/or owners, the form of business organization, type of goods and services provided and method of conducting sales. Such notice must be received by the Bank within five (5) business days of the change. The Customer shall provide any additional information requested by the Bank within five (5) business days of such request.
1.5 Security Procedures.
The Bank shall provide the Customer with one or more identification number(s) (“MainStreet Bank Online Banking ID(s)”, “User ID”, or “ID(s)”) and a MainStreet Bank Online Banking Password (“Password”) (collectively, a “Security Code”) to access the Online Service. The use of the Security Code, in addition to other authentication methods described below, is a security procedure established by the Bank to authenticate the identity of the person attempting to gain access to the Service (“Security Procedure”). The Security Procedure is not designed for the detection of errors. The Bank may require the Customer to change its Security Code from time to time for security reasons. The Customer should keep its Security Code in a secure location. Any person having access to the Customer’s Security Procedures will be able to access these Services and perform all transactions, including reviewing Account information and making Transfers to other Accounts and to other persons. The Customer, or if the Customer is a Business or non-personal Customer, the Customer’s User(s), agents, and employees are responsible for safeguarding its Security Procedures. Providing these Security Procedures to another person effectively constitutes a grant of authority to access the Customer’s Accounts.
If the Customer is a Business or non-personal Customer, in addition to the Security Code(s) provided by the Bank to the Customer, the Bank will also make available “Commercially Reasonable Security Procedures” (“Security Procedures”) that the Customer can elect to use. The Bank may require the Customer to accept certain Security Procedures based on the Service(s) the Customer chooses to enroll in or the Customer’s activity. The Bank may also at any time and from time to time at its sole discretion, enable certain Security Procedures if the Bank, in its judgment and discretion, believe such change to be necessary or desirable to protect the security of the Bank’s systems and assets.
If the Customer is a Business or non-personal Customer, the Customer acknowledges that the Bank has offered to the Customer Security Procedures to verify the authenticity of transactions, which Procedures the Customer agrees are reasonable in the context of the Customer’s operation, requirements and internal procedures. The Customer acknowledges that the Bank has offered this Service and the Customer has elected to make transactions using the Customer’s selected Security Procedures. The Customer acknowledges and understands that selecting Security Procedures other than those offered by the Bank may substantially increase the risk of loss to the Customer. THE CUSTOMER HEREBY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY TRANSACTION, WHETHER OR NOT AUTHORIZED, ISSUED IN CUSTOMER’S NAME AND ACCEPTED BY BANK IN COMPLIANCE WITH CUSTOMER’S SELECTED SECURITY PROCEDURES.
a. The Customer agrees to keep all Security Procedures and Security Devices protected, secure, and strictly confidential and if the Customer is a Business or non-personal Customer, to provide or make available the same only to the Customer’s authorized representative(s). The Customer agrees not to disclose or provide any Security Procedures or Security Devices to any unauthorized person. The Customer also agrees that Users shall not share Security Procedures or Security Devices with each other. Where it has the ability to change or modify a Security Procedure or Security Device from time to time (e.g., an ID or Password), the Customer agrees to change Security Procedures and Security Devices frequently in order to ensure the security of the Security Procedure and Security Device. The Customer agrees to notify the Bank immediately, according to notification procedures prescribed by the Bank, if the Customer believes that any Security Procedures or Security Device has been stolen, compromised, or otherwise become known to persons other than the Customer or, if the Customer is a Business or non-personal Customer, its authorized representative(s), or if the Customer believes that any transaction or activity is unauthorized or in error. In the event of any actual or threatened breach of security, the Bank may issue the Customer a new Security Device or establish new Security Procedures as soon as reasonably practicable, but the Bank shall not be liable to the Customer or any third party for any delay in taking such actions. The Customer agrees to indemnify, defend all claims, and hold the Bank harmless from any loss, damages, or expenses, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, caused by the Customer, or if the Customer is a Business or non-personal Customer, your employees’, or agents’ failure to keep the Security Procedures or Security Devices confidential and secure.
b. The Bank reserves the right to modify, amend, supplement, or cancel any or all Security Procedures, and/or replace any or all Security Devices, at any time and from time to time at its sole discretion. The Bank will endeavor to give the Customer reasonable notice of any change in Security Procedures or Security Devices; provided that the Bank may make any change in Security Procedures or Security Devices without advance notice to the Customer if the Bank, in its judgment and discretion, believe such change to be necessary or desirable to protect the security of the Bank’s systems and assets. The Customer’s implementation and use of any changed Security Procedures or Security Devices after any change in Security Procedures or Security Devices shall constitute the Customer’s agreement to the change and the Customer’s agreement that the applicable Security Procedures and Security Devices, as changed, are commercially reasonable and adequate for the purposes intended.
1.6 Physical and Electronic Security.
a. The Customer is solely responsible for providing for and maintaining the physical, electronic, procedural, administrative, and technical security of data and systems in the Customer’s possession or under the Customer’s control. The Bank is not responsible for any computer viruses (including, without limitation, programs commonly referred to as “malware,” “keystroke loggers,” and/or “spyware”), problems or malfunctions resulting from any computer viruses, or any related problems that may be associated with the use of an online system or any other Service(s) provided by the Bank. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained is obtained at the Customer’s own discretion and risk, and the Bank is not responsible for any damage to the Customer’s computer or operating systems or for loss of data that results from the download of any such material, whether due to any computer virus or otherwise. The Customer is solely responsible for maintaining and applying anti-virus software, security patches, firewalls, and other security measures with respect to the Customer’s operating systems, and for protecting, securing, and backing up any data and information stored in or on the Customer’s operating systems. The Bank is not responsible for any errors or failures resulting from defects in or malfunctions of any software installed on the Customer’s operating systems or accessed through an Internet connection.
b. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is the Customer’s responsibility to protect itself and to be vigilant against e-mail fraud and other internet frauds and schemes (including, without limitation, fraud commonly referred to as “phishing” and “pharming”). If the Customer is a Business or non-personal Customer, the Customer agrees to educate User(s), agents, and employees as to the risks of such fraud and to train such persons to avoid such risks. The Customer acknowledges that the Bank will never contact the Customer by a non-encrypted e-mail or unsecure message in order to ask for or to verify Account numbers, Security Procedures or Security Devices, or any sensitive or confidential information as applicable. In the event the Customer receives an e-mail or other electronic communication that the Customer believes, or has reason to believe, is fraudulent, the Customer agrees that neither the Customer, or if the Customer is a Business or non-personal Customer, the Customer’s User(s), agents, nor employees shall respond to the e-mail, provide any information to the e-mail sender, click on any links in the e-mail, or otherwise comply with any instructions in the e-mail. The Customer agrees that the Bank is not responsible for any losses, injuries, or harm incurred by the Customer as a result of any electronic, e-mail, or Internet fraud.
c. There are security risks associated with the Service(s) offered by the Bank. The hardware and software that the Customer use(s) in connection with the Service may be subject to unauthorized tracking or other manipulation by spyware or other malicious code. The Bank is not responsible for advising the Customer of the existence or potential effect of such malicious code, and the Customer’s use of its hardware and software is at the Customer’s own risk. The Bank will use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the Service to prevent access by unauthorized persons and to prevent the introduction of any malicious code, such as a computer virus. However, no security system is failsafe, and despite the Bank’s efforts the security of the Service could be compromised or malicious code could be introduced by third parties. The Bank will provide the Customer with notice if the Customer’s information is the subject of a security breach as required by applicable law.
d. In the event of a breach of the Customer’s Security Procedure(s) or Security Device(s) as applicable, the Customer agrees to assist the Bank in determining the manner and source of the breach. Such assistance shall include, but shall not be limited to, providing the Bank or the Bank’s agent access to the Customer’s hard drive, storage media and devices, systems and any other equipment or device that was used in breach of the Security Procedure or Security Device. The Customer further agrees to provide to the Bank any analysis of such equipment, device, or software or any report of such analysis performed by the Customer, the Customer’s agents, law enforcement agencies, or any other third party as applicable. Failure of the Customer to assist the Bank shall be an admission by the Customer that the breach of the Customer’s Security Procedure or Security Device was caused by a person who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the Customer or who obtained information facilitating the breach of the Customer’s Security Procedure or Security Device from the Customer and not from a source controlled by the Bank.
1.7 Hardware and Software.
The Customer understands it must, and hereby agrees to, at its sole cost and expense, use computer hardware and software that meets all technical requirements for the proper delivery of the Online Service and that fulfills the Customer’s obligation to obtain and maintain secure access to the Internet. The Customer understands and agrees it may also incur, and shall pay, any and all expenses related to the use of the Online Service, including, but not limited to, telephone service or Internet service charges. The Customer is solely responsible for the payment of any and all costs and expenses associated with meeting and maintaining all technical requirements and additional items necessary for the proper use of the Online Service. The Customer understands and agrees that it is solely responsible for the operation, maintenance and updating of all equipment, software and services used in connection with the Online Service and the cost thereof, and the Customer hereby agrees that it will perform, or cause to be performed, all vendor recommended maintenance, repairs, upgrades and replacements, and such performance shall be rendered by properly trained personnel, whether they are the Customer, employees of the Customer, or third-party employees. The Bank is not responsible for, and the Customer hereby releases the Bank from any and all claims or damages resulting from, or related to, any computer virus or related problems that may be associated with using electronic mail or the Internet to deliver the Online Service. The Bank is not responsible for any errors or failures resulting from defects in or malfunctions of the Customer’s computer hardware or software. In addition to installing antivirus software, the Customer hereby agrees to scan its computer hardware and software on a regular basis (one or more times per month) using a reliable computer virus detection product in order to detect and remove computer viruses.

Unless otherwise expressly authorized, the Customer may not (1) copy, reproduce, transmit, retransmit, disseminate, display, publish, sell, broadcast, circulate, distribute, transfer, assign, commercially exploit, reverse engineer, reverse compile or create derivative works of, the Software in any form or (2) copy, reproduce, transmit, retransmit, disseminate, display, publish, sell, broadcast, circulate, distribute, transfer, assign, commercially exploit the Documentation.
1.8 Internet Disclaimer.
The Bank does not and cannot control the flow of data to or from the Bank’s network and other portions of the Internet. Such flow depends in large part on the performance of Internet Services provided or controlled by third parties. Actions or inactions of such third parties can impair or disrupt the Customer’s connections to the Internet (or portions thereof). The Bank cannot guarantee that such events will not occur. Accordingly, the Bank disclaims any and all liability resulting from or related to such events and in no event shall the Bank be liable for any damages (whether in contract or in tort) that are attributable to the public Internet infrastructure, the Customer’s ability to connect to the Internet, or the Bank’s ability to connect to the Internet on the Customer’s behalf.
1.9 Service Limits.
The Customer agrees that the Bank may establish limits or restrictions on Services provided through the Online Service and that the Bank may amend those limits without notice. The limits or restrictions may apply to transaction amounts, types of accounts that are eligible for the Service, the frequency of the transactions or any other limits or restrictions that the Bank deems necessary. The Customer agrees to abide by and honor the limits or restrictions established by the Bank. The Customer also agrees that the Bank shall have no liability to the Customer for refusal to process any transaction or to act on any request by the Customer that exceeds the limit or restriction, or if the Customer has insufficient available funds to effect any transactions.
1.10 Changes and Modifications.
The Bank may amend, add to, modify or delete the terms or replace these Online Service Terms and Conditions in its entirety at any time, in its sole discretion, by giving written notice to the Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank may amend the Personal or Business Fee Schedule at any time, in its sole discretion with or without notice to the Customer. In the event performance of the Online Service provided herein in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Online Service would result in a violation of any present or future statute, regulations or government policy to which the Bank is subject, and which governs or affects the transactions contemplated by this Online Service, then this Online Service shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to comply with such statute, regulation or policy, and the Bank shall incur no liability to the Customer as a result of such violation or amendment. Any practices or course of dealings between the Bank and the Customer, or any procedures or operational alternatives used by them, shall not constitute a modification of these Online Service Terms and Conditions, nor shall they be construed as an amendment to these Online Service Terms and Conditions.
Further, the Bank may, from time to time, revise or update, or perform maintenance upon, its program, the Online Service, and/or related material, resulting in interrupted service or errors in the Online Service or rendering prior versions obsolete. The Bank also may need to change the scope of the Online Service from time to time. The Bank will attempt to provide prior notice of such interruptions and changes but cannot guarantee that such notice will be provided. The Bank reserves the right to terminate these terms and conditions as to all prior versions of its programs, the Online Service, and/or related material and limit access to the Banks more recent versions and updates. Use of the Online Service after the effective date of any such revisions, updates, and/or changes will constitute the Customer’s consent to the same.

The Customer must report all other errors within a reasonable time not to exceed fourteen (14) days from the date that the error is made. Except as outlined in Section 1.38, failure of the Customer to promptly report errors within such specified time shall preclude the Customer from asserting the error, discrepancy or any loss caused by the error against the Bank.
The Customer should notify the Bank immediately if it believes any Security Code has been lost or stolen, that someone has gained access to the Customer’s Security Procedure(s) or Security Device(s), or that someone has transferred or may transfer money from the Customer’s Account without its permission or if the Customer suspects any fraudulent activity on its Account.

Should the Customer fail or refuse to pay any charges for the Online Service or services accessed through the Online Service, the Customer agrees to pay all collection costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees) which may be incurred by the Bank. The Bank shall have the right to increase or decrease any charges imposed for the Services.

The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Bank will not examine checks, drafts and other items issued by the Customer or payable to the Customer and received by the Bank and processed in conjunction with the Online Service rendered by the Bank. Therefore, legends and other instructions placed on items by the Customer or other parties, such as, but not limited to, “not valid over $500,” “void after 90 days,” “full accord and satisfaction,” shall not be discovered by the Bank, shall not be binding on the Bank and shall not be enforceable against the Bank. Likewise, the Bank shall not discover alterations, postdated checks, stale dated checks, number of required signatures on checks, or discrepancies between the amount of the check or item as written in numbers and words, or other irregularities on the face of the check or item.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS, THE BANK SHALL BE EXCUSED FROM FAILING TO ACT OR DELAY IN ACTING IF SUCH FAILURE OR DELAY IS CAUSED BY LEGAL CONSTRAINT, INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION OR COMMUNICATION FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT FAILURE, WAR, EMERGENCY CONDITIONS OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE BANK’S CONTROL.

Without limiting or superseding any of the indemnification provided to the Bank in the Online Service Terms and Conditions provided herein, except for those losses caused directly by the Bank’s failure to exercise ordinary care or to act in good faith, the Customer agrees to indemnify and hold the Bank, its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees and affiliates, and their respected officers, directors, agents and employees, harmless from and against any and all losses, costs, suits, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or related in any way to (i) any Services performed in connection with the Online Service, (ii) the Bank’s action or inaction in accordance with or reliance upon any instructions or information received from any person reasonably believed by the Bank to be the Customer, or if the Customer is a business or non-personal Customer, an Authorized User, (iii) the Customer’s breach of any of the Customer’s covenants, agreements, responsibilities, representations or warranties under these terms and conditions, and/or (iv) the Customer’s breach of applicable laws, rules or regulations.
1.26 Termination.
The Customer and the Bank have the right to terminate these terms and conditions or the Online Service without cause upon ten (10) days advanced written notice to either party. Such notice sent by the Customer to the Bank shall be sent to the address described in Section 1.1 contained herein. Such notice by the Bank to the Customer may be delivered or sent by U.S. Mail or private courier to the mailing address on file for the Customer, by electronic delivery to the email address on file for the Customer, or any other method allowed by law, and unless otherwise provided herein, such notices shall be deemed given to the Customer when sent. Such termination shall not be effective until it is actually received and acknowledged by the Bank. Since the service cancellation request can take several days to process, the Customer should cancel all outstanding payment or transfer orders or other pending transactions, in addition to notifying the Bank of its desire to terminate the Online Service. The Bank will not be liable for payments, transfers, or other transactions not cancelled or payments, transfers or transactions made due to the lack of proper notification by the Customer of the Online Service termination or discontinuance for any reason. The Bank reserves the right to terminate or suspend the Customer’s use of the Service in whole or in part at any time with or without notice. Upon termination, the Customer shall return all software, hardware, storage media, procedure manuals, and all other property of the Bank as applicable. In the event of termination or suspension by the Bank or by the Customer, the Customer shall remain liable for all charges incurred through the date of termination. All substantive and procedural provisions hereof relative to liabilities of the parties shall survive any termination of these terms and conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank may terminate these terms and conditions and the Online Service immediately by giving written notice to the Customer if: (a) the Customer ceases to conduct business in the ordinary sense, (b) the Customer fails to perform or comply with any of the Online Service Terms and Conditions contained herein, or defaults under any other agreement between the Bank and the Customer, (c) if any proceeding for voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceedings is commenced by or against the Customer.
1.27 Suspension of Services.
Without liability to any party, and without limiting any other right or remedy available to the Bank, the Bank shall be entitled to cease or suspend any Service, in whole or in part, at the Bank’s sole discretion and with or without notice to the Customer.

THE CUSTOMER AND THE BANK AGREE THAT THE TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED UNDER THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS INVOLVES “COMMERCE” UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (“FAA”). ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER AND THE BANK, OR BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER AND ANY OF THE BANK’S OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR AFFILIATED ENTITIES, THAT ARISE OUT OF OR IS RELATED TO THE ONLINE SERVICE OR ANY SERVICE PROVIDED THROUGH THE ONLINE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF FRAUD, SUPPRESSION, MISREPRESENTATION AND FRAUD IN THE INDUCEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, ANY “CLAIM”), WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE FAA. THE PARTIES SHALL WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO SELECT AND AGREE UPON AN ARBITRATOR WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER A DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE SOLE DISCRETION TO USE ANY COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RULES OF ARBITRATION, UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO IN WRITING BY THE PARTIES. IF THE PARTIES CANNOT AGREE UPON AN ARBITRATOR, THEN EACH PARTY SHALL DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR REPRESENTATIVE AND THE ARBITRATOR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL SELECT THE ARBITRATOR.

1.33.3 Restrictions; Limits. In most cases you may use the Online Service to gain access to deposit accounts in which you have an unrestricted right to withdraw funds.

1.33.4 Vendor. You acknowledge and agree that the Online Service is provided by an independent third party service provider (“Vendor”) as selected by the Bank and that both the Vendor and the Online Service are subject to change from time to time without notice to you.

Neither the Bank nor the Vendor is responsible for the actions or omissions of the other
1.33.5 Availability of Service. We will use reasonable efforts to make the Online Service available for your use on a continuous basis. The Online Service may be unavailable for short periods of time for regular or emergency system maintenance. We will endeavor to have our scheduled maintenance occur during non-peak hours.

We reserve the right at all times to take actions to protect our systems and information, including denial of access to users of the Online Service.
1.34 Additional Information about the Services.
1.34.1 Account Access. Transfers and Payments from your Account(s) through the Online Service or the Mobile Banking Service will be deducted on the date you instruct us to process the Transfer. If the date you schedule a Transfer or Payment falls on a weekend or holiday, we will process your transaction the next Transfer Day. We may refuse to act on your Transfer instructions or Payment request if sufficient funds, including funds available under any overdraft protection plan, are not available in your Account(s) on the date you want us to make the Transfer or Payment.
1.34.2 Processing Fund Transfers. We can process a Transfer until the Cut-Off Time located in the Bank’s Processing Schedule on a Transfer Day. If you request a Transfer after the cutoff time, the Transfer will be processed the following Transfer Day. If you schedule a Transfer for a future date, we will process the transaction after the close of business on that date, if that day is a Transfer Day.
You are fully obligated to us to provide sufficient funds for any transfers you make or authorize to be made. If we complete a transfer that you make or authorize and we subsequently learn that you have insufficient funds for the transaction, you agree that we may reverse the transaction or offset the shortage with funds from any other deposit account(s) you have with us to the extent permissible by the applicable law and the terms of any other relevant agreements.
If there are insufficient funds in your Account to make a Transfer, we may refuse to make the Transfer or we may make the Transfer and overdraw your Account. In either event, you are responsible for any non-sufficient funds (“NSF”) charges that may apply.
1.34.3 Cancelling Transfers. You may cancel a pending Transfer or Payment transaction. However, to do so, we must receive your instruction through the Online Service to cancel prior to the cutoff time on the Transfer Day the transaction is scheduled to be processed. If we don’t receive your instruction to cancel a transaction before that time, we may process the transaction.
1.34.4 Transfer(s) from Savings/Money Market Deposit Accounts. Federal regulations require us to limit, either by contract or in practice, the number of certain types of transfers from savings and money market deposit accounts. You are limited to six (6) preauthorized electronic fund transfers per monthly statement period. Each funds transfer through the Online Service from your savings or money market deposit account is counted as one (1) of the six (6) transfers permitted each monthly statement cycle. However, payments to your loan accounts with us are not counted toward this transfer limit for savings/money market deposit accounts.
1.34.5 E-Mails. The Bank may not immediately receive an e-mail that you send. Therefore, you should not rely on e-mail if you need to communicate to the Bank immediately. For example, if you need to stop payment on a check, to report a lost or stolen card, or to report an unauthorized transaction from one of your accounts, you should contact the Bank immediately by calling us (see Section 1.1). The Bank will not take actions based on your e-mail requests until the Bank actually receives your message and has a reasonable opportunity to act.
1.34.6 Overdrafts; Order of Payments, Transfers, and Other Withdrawals. If funds are withdrawn from any of your accounts by means of electronic funds transfers, other than through the Online Service on the same business day as an Online Service transaction, and if the account contains insufficient funds to enable both the electronic funds transfer and the Online Service transfer to be made, then the electronic funds transfer will have priority and the Online Banking Services transfer will be refused or will result in an overdraft on your account. This is at the Bank’s sole discretion.
1.34.7 Stop Payment Orders. Any stop payment order which the Customer wishes to place on a check drawn on an account that is the subject of this Online Service or is otherwise related to this Online Service shall be placed in accordance with the Bank’s normal stop payment procedures and provisions for other accounts in effect at that time. The Customer acknowledges that a Stop Payment Request (defined herein below) may not be placed on any items other than checks issued by the Customer. Any Stop Payment Request for ACH debits or paper drafts must be placed at a Bank branch office location. If the Customer has elected to issue stop payment orders via Online Service, the following provisions shall apply:
1.34.7.1 You have requested us to provide Stop Payment Services under the Online Service to enable you to electronically issue stop payment entries (“Stop Payment Request”). You hereby agree to use the Stop Payment Services according to the instructions set forth in this Section.
1.34.7.2 You may only submit Stop Payment Requests for checks that have not yet posted to the Account. Thus, prior to submitting Stop Payment Requests, you must first verify that the checks have not posted to the Account.
1.34.7.3 You understand and agree that Stop Payment Requests will not take effect unless you provide all the information requested by the Stop Payment screens and provide such information exactly as it appears on the check, including, but not limited to, the account number, check number, amount, payee and date. You acknowledge that the computer programs used to provide the Stop Payment Services require exact information regarding the check and even minor errors in providing the exact information requested may prevent the payment from being stopped. For example, if you give us the wrong amount of the check and the information is only wrong by one cent (.01) or if the check number you provide is only wrong by one digit, we will not be able to stop payment on the check. You agree that the Bank is not liable to you for payment of any check over a Stop Payment Request if you do not provide the exact information regarding the check.
1.34.7.4 Stop Payment Requests that we receive prior to the Cut-Off Time located in the Bank’s Processing Schedule on a Business Day, will be effective on that Business Day. Stop Payment Requests that we receive after that cut-off time may take effect on the next Business Day. The Business Day on which the Stop Payment Request takes effect is referred as the “Stop Payment Effective Date.” We shall not be liable to you for items otherwise properly payable that we pay prior to the Stop Payment Effective Date of your Stop Payment Request or any loss arising out of such payment.
1.34.7.5 The Stop Payment Request will be effective for six (6) months, from and including the Stop Payment Effective Date. You may renew or otherwise continue the effectiveness of a Stop Payment Request by making a new Stop Payment Request via the Online Service at least one (1) Business Day prior to the expiration of the existing Stop Payment Request. You acknowledge that we are not obligated to stop payment on a check after the expiration of a Stop Payment Request. However, you agree that we may stop payment according to an expired Stop Payment Request without incurring any liability to you. You further understand and agree that you, and not us, have the obligation to monitor your Stop Payment Requests and that we will not provide you with any notice of the expiration dates of any Stop Payment Request and/or the need to renew any such requests.
1.34.7.6 You understand and agree that we will accept a Stop Payment Request and use reasonable procedures to locate and stop payment on the check. However, in consideration of our acceptance of the Stop Payment Request, you expressly agree to hold us harmless from any direct or indirect damages if we pay the check (i) on the day we receive the Stop Payment Request, or (ii) by reason of oversight or inadvertence. Furthermore, you hereby agree that we will not be liable to you for any direct or indirect damages if other checks drawn by you are returned NSF because we pay the check under the circumstances noted in (i) or (ii) herein. You further agree to indemnify us against all expenses and costs that might incur by reason of stopping payment on a check pursuant to a Stop Payment Request, whether it expired or not.
1.34.7.7 You hereby authorize us to automatically charge the Account against which the check was drawn for applicable Stop Payment fees for each Stop Payment Request and renewal thereof.
1.35 Bill Payment Service.
1.35.1 The Bill Pay Service allows you to schedule bill payments through the Online Service. Bill payments cannot be made from savings accounts, IRAs, lines of credit, installment loans, or certificates of deposit, and, because of the limitations discussed in Section 1.34.4, bill payments may not be made from money market accounts.
1.35.2 Eligible Payees: You may only designate payees with addresses in the United States. We reserve the right to determine who may be a payee. You may not use the Bill Pay Service to purchase securities, to make federal or state tax payments, or to comply with any court order.
1.35.3 Initiating Payments: To initiate a payment, you must identify the person or business you are paying, the payment date, the amount to be paid, and (if you have one) your account number with the payee. You may be asked for additional information when you establish a payee for the first time on our system. You may pay an unlimited number of payees using the Bill Pay Service.
1.35.4 Erroneous Payment Requests. You assume sole responsibility for providing us with complete and accurate payment information. We are not responsible for confirming such information, or for identifying or rejecting errors or duplicate payment instructions. If you give us a payment instruction that is incorrect in any way, you agree that we may charge your account for the payment, whether or not the error could have been detected by us. We are not obligated to detect errors in your transfer or payment instructions.
1.35.5 Processing Payments. The Bank must receive the Customer’s request prior to the Cut-Off Time located in the Bank’s Processing Schedule. The business day you instruct us to process the payment is the “Payment Initiation Date”. For payments entered prior to the Cut-Off Time on the Payment Initiation Date and that are to be paid electronically, we will withdraw funds from your designated account on the Payment Initiation Date and then will process an Automated Clearing House (electronic) payment on the following business day to the payee. For payments entered prior to the Cut-Off Time on the Payment Initiation Date and that are to be paid by check, we will mail a check to the payee on the Payment Initiation Date. The funds will not be withdrawn from your account until the payee deposits the check and it clears through the Bank. Payments that are to be made either electronically or via check that are entered at or after the Cut-Off Time on the Payment Initiation Date, or anytime on a non-business day, will be processed at the first processing time on the next business day. We do not have to make a payment if you do not have sufficient funds or credit available for the payment on the Payment Initiation Date. Although you can enter a payment request twenty four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, your designated Payment Initiation Date must be on a business day. If you direct us to make a payment on a day other than a business day, we will initiate the payment on the following business day.
1.35.6 Scheduling Payments. You should schedule payments sufficiently in advance to ensure that they are received and credited by your payee by the payment due date. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU SCHEDULE THE PAYMENT INITIATION DATE AT LEAST FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE DATE THE PAYMENT IS DUE AT YOUR PAYEE WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY GRACE PERIOD. Although we may be able to pay certain payees electronically within two business days, it could take longer for payments sent by mail. It is your responsibility to request that payments be made in such a manner that they will be paid on time. You are solely responsible for any damages, such as late fees and finance charges, which may be imposed as a result of your failure to identify the correct Payment Initiation Date and transmit your payment instruction to us in a timely manner. To ensure that critical or time-sensitive payments are received on time, you should consider establishing payment dates (especially for payees that will receive payment by mail during peak holiday periods) well in advance of the payment due date. We will not be responsible for any charges imposed or any other action taken by a payee resulting from a payment that you have not scheduled properly. In addition, we will not be liable if any third party through which any bill payment is made (e.g., the postal system) fails to properly transmit the payment to the intended payee.
1.35.7 Changing or Canceling Payments. You may cancel or change any scheduled payment by utilizing the Online Service up until the time it is processed on the Payment Initiation Date. If the payment has been entered or scheduled prior to the cut-off time specified in the Bank’s Processing Schedule on the Payment Initiation Date, you have until the cut-off time to change, modify or delete that payment. You may also contact us (see Section 1.1) in time for us to receive your request three business days or more before the payment is scheduled to be processed. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within seven (7) days after you call.
1.35.8 Rejecting Payment Requests. We may reject any payment request with or without cause or prior notice. If we do, we will notify you promptly of the rejection orally, electronically or in writing.
1.35.9 Joint Accounts. Since joint account holders share the same payee list, any account owner or authorized signer may (a) authorize transfers and payments to or from joint accounts, (b) cancel payments, and (c) remove any payee from the list.
1.36 Mobile Banking Service.
1.36.1 Description of the Mobile Banking Service. The Mobile Banking Service refers generally to any service allowing an existing Bank customer to access and view Accounts from a web-enabled mobile phone or device (“Mobile Device”) whose network allows secure SSL traffic and supports WAP browsers. We do not guarantee the functionality of the Service on all wireless devices or networks; however, generally, the Service should be compatible with any web-enabled mobile phone or other Mobile Device, regardless of make, model, or mobile service provider. This proprietary solution adapts to any screen size and can change dynamically to present items on any screen in a pleasing format. The Mobile Banking Service allows you, but does not limit you to view transaction history, view Account balances, view account transaction history, transfer funds between Accounts, pay bills to payees, view alerts, initiate saved wires, and initiate saved ACH batches. Some features of the Service, including but not limited to Mobile Deposit, can only be accessed through the MainStreet Bank Mobile Banking Application (“App.”). If you have selected and are approved for the Mobile Deposit Service, you may remotely make deposits. In most cases you may use the Service to gain access to deposit accounts in which you have an unrestricted right to withdraw funds. However, the Bank, as it may determine at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, may deny Service account access, restrict Service account transactions, or place limits on the specific dollar amount of funds that may be withdrawn and transferred from any account.
You acknowledge and agree that these services may be provided by a Vendor as selected by the Bank and that both the Vendor and the Service are subject to change from time to time without notice to you. You further acknowledge, agree, and stipulate that the Vendor is an independent contractor providing software and data transmission services and is not an agent of you or the Bank.
