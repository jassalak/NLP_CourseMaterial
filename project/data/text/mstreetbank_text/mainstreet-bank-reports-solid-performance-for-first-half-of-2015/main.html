MainStreet Bank Reports Solid Performance for First Half of 2015
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) completed the first half of 2015 with net income of $871 thousand, up 63% from the first half of 2014 reported earnings of $536 thousand. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income as a result of period-over-period growth. Fully diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2015 were 21 cents as compared with 20 cents for the first half of 2014. However, the weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1,531,203 between the two periods, largely due to a capital raise that occurred at the end of 2014.
Net interest income increased by approximately $1.4 million during the first half of 2015 compared to 2014. Net interest income totaled approximately $7.2 million during the period, representing a net interest margin of 4.25%.
Total assets on June 30, 2015 were $375.6 million, compared to $345 million at the end of 2014.
Loans outstanding increased by $36.3 million during the first half, from $269.1 million on Dec. 31, 2014 to $305.4 million on June 30, 2015. Loans have increased by $58.2 million in the year since June 30, 2014.
Total deposits increased by $30.3 million during the first half of 2015 reaching $332.7 million. Total deposits increased by $44.5 million, or 15%, since the same period in 2014. Year over year demand account balances increased by $20.7 million, while money market and interest checking accounts increased by $14.5 million, increases of 55% and 20% respectively. Conversely, time deposits only increased by $4.2 million, or 2%, during the same period.
MainStreet recorded a loan loss provision of $580 thousand in the first half of 2015, compared to $123 thousand in 2014. The difference is primarily attributable to loan growth and the balance has remained consistently near 1% with only nominal losses.
Asset quality remains very strong. Nonperforming loans were 0.14 percent of total loans on June 30, 2015. As a comparison, the average for the 1,239 banks in MainStreet’s national peer group is 1.05% as of March 31, 2015, or 7.5 times higher than MainStreet’s loan portfolio.
For the first half of 2015, non-interest income was $643 thousand, compared to $387 thousand for the same period in 2014. Non-interest expense in the first half of 2015 was $5.9 million, compared to $4.9 million in the first half of 2014. The increase was driven primarily by personnel related expenses associated with the growth and expansion during 2014, which allowed the company to experience high quality growth.

Dick, Chairman, CEO and President of MainStreet Bank. “As we grow, we will reap the benefits of that infrastructure and continue to improve the efficiency of the organization.”
