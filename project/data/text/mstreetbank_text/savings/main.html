The following activities do not count toward earning account rewards: ATM-processed transactions, transfers between accounts, debit card purchases processed by merchants and received by MainStreet Bank as ATM, PIN-based or signature based transactions and purchases made with non-MainStreet Bank issued debit cards. “Monthly Qualification Cycle” means a period beginning one (1) day prior to the first day of the current statement cycle through one (1) day prior to the close of the current statement cycle.

Kasasa Saver: Balances up to $15,000.00 receive APY of 0.75%; and balances over $15,000.00 earn 0.25% interest rate on the portion of balance over $15,000.00, resulting in a range from 0.25% to 0.75% APY depending on the account’s balance.
Kasasa Cash: Balances up to $15,000.00 receive an APY of 2.00%; and balances over $15,000.00 earn0.25% interest rate on the portion of balance over $15,000.00, resulting in a range from 0.25% to 2.00% APY depending on the account’s balance.
Kasasa Cash Back: 2.00% cash back on up to a total of $400.00 PIN-based/signature based debit card purchases that post and settle to the account during that cycle period. A maximum of $8.00 cash back may be earned per Monthly Qualification Cycle.
When Kasasa Cash or Cash Back qualifications are not met,
Kasasa Saver: All balances earn 0.05 APY.
Kasasa Cash: All balances earn 0.05 APY*.
Kasasa Cash Back: No cash back payments are made.
When linked to the Kasasa Saver account, the interest earned within the Kasasa Cash account does not compound since it is automatically transferred to the Kasasa Saver account the day after being credited to your Kasasa Cash account. Consequently, when linked to Kasasa Saver, and your Kasasa Cash qualifications are met, balances up to $15,000.00 in your Kasasa Cash account receive a non-compounding APY of 0.75%; and balances over $15,000.00 earn 0.25% interest rate on the portion of the balance over $15,000.00, resulting in a non-compounding range from 0.25% to 0.75% APY depending on the account’s balance.
