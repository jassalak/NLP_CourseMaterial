Funding a Better Tomorrow
MainStreet Bank Chairman, CEO and President Jeff W. Dick was selected Indie Banker of the Month by the Independent Community Bankers of America (www.ICBA.org). The article, published August 2013, showcases the Bank’s dedication to community support, charitable causes, and innovation.
“There was a time when over 20 percent of community bank deposits were in noninterest checking accounts. Now, in an age when online banking portals provide customers with the ultimate convenience to manage their funds anytime, that number is down to about 10 percent, says Jeff W. Dick, CEO, Chairman and President of MainStreet Bank in Fairfax, Va.
What’s a community bank to do?
“Innovate,” Dick responds. Community banks need to create new products to provide additional sources of low- or no-interest deposits. And that product for MainStreet Bank is aircharity.”
