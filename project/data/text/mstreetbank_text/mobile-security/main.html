Mobile Security
You should treat your Mobile device just as you would your PC or Laptop to prevent unauthorized access. As more and more users turn to the convenience of mobile devices and applications, you should expect the threat of hacking attempts to rise.
To protect yourself from mobile fraud like viruses, malware, fake apps, and lost and stolen devices you can follow some basic tips:
Keep your device updated. Periodically carriers and developers will release updates to fix bugs and stay in tune with new technology requirements. You should take advantage of the updates as they are released.
Protect your mobile device just as you would your computer. Secure it with a passcode and use caution when visiting sites and giving out personal sensitive information.
Review App privacy policies before downloading and installing on your device. Ensure the app has permission to access only relative data and that it comes from a reputable source.
When making purchases on your mobile device, ensure the site is secure. Some sites will show a lock icon in the address bar, some will turn green, and all should read “https:” in the address bar.
Don’t jailbreak your device. While it may be tempting to have the ability to access more apps or functions, by jail-breaking your device you also remove the built in security from the manufacturer. This leaves your device more susceptible to viruses and malware.
Be cautious of links or phone numbers embedded in emails, text messages, and posts within social media sites.
If you’re unsure – never respond or give out information until you are sure.
