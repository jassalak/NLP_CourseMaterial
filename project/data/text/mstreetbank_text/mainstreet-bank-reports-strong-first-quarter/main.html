MainStreet Bank Reports Strong First Quarter
Fairfax, VA – MainStreet Bank (OTCQB: MNSB) completed the first quarter of 2015 with net income of $465 thousand, which is up substantially from the first quarter of 2014.
“We are seeing the results of all of our efforts coming together at this point,” said Chairman, CEO and President Jeff W. Dick. “Solid loan and deposit growth combined with extensive expense control continues to enhance earnings. And, the Bank’s capital structure is well suited to support future growth.”
The Bank reports total assets of $359 million, gross loans of $290 million and total deposits of $317 million. The Bank remains very well capitalized and loan quality remains extremely strong.
MainStreet Bank is always looking for ways to improve its customer experience, and now has the ability to instantly issue new and replacement Debit Cards – which is especially important for customers if their Cards are lost or compromised.
MainStreet Bank also continues to refine and improve its mobile banking App, which works on iPads, iPhones and Androids. Additionally, MainStreet Bank released Aircharity® in 2012. Aircharity® is a unique solution that empowers people and organizations to raise money via email, websites and social media. The product allows a customer to open an account and accept donations from debit cards, credit cards and electronic checks.
MainStreet operates five branches in Herndon, Fairfax, Fairfax City, McLean and Clarendon. In addition, MainStreet has 55,000 free ATMs and an online banking solution called “Airbanking®”. The Bank is not restricted by a conventional branching system, as it can offer business customers the ability to Put Our Bank in Your Office®. With robust and easy-to-use online business banking technology, MainStreet has literally “put our bank” in well over 600 businesses in the Metropolitan area and across the United States.
MainStreet Bank was the first community bank in the Washington, DC Metropolitan area to offer a full online business banking solution.
