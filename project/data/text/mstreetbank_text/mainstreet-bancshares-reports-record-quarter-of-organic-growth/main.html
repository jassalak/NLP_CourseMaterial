MainStreet Bancshares Reports Record Quarter of Organic Growth
Fairfax, VA — MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. (OTCQB: MNSB), the holding company for MainStreet Bank, reported its best ever quarter of organic growth. Total assets grew 13.4% quarter-on-quarter, from $568 million at March 31, 2017 to $644 million at June 30, 2017. Net loans grew 13.9% to $526 million at June 30, 2017. Year-on-year, total assets grew 25.6% and net loans grew 25.9% from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017.
Total deposits as of June 30, 2017 were $539 million, or $115 million over total deposits of $423 million at June 30, 2016. The component of non-interest bearing deposits grew 41.1% from $98.5 million at June 30, 2016 to $139 million at June 30, 2017. Of significance is the continued rise in the level of non-interest bearing deposits, which represent 25.8% of total deposits at June 30, 2017, up 2.3% from June 30, 2016.
Of course the substantial growth in loans was met with a higher than normal loan provision expense of $425 thousand for the second quarter of 2017, which is more than double the amount required for the first quarter of 2017. The loan provision expense is a direct function of the growth in loans. The overall quality of the loan portfolio remains strong, with non-performing loans at just two basis points.
Dialing in the higher than normal loss provision expense, the Company still achieved net income of $950 thousand for the second quarter of 2017, bringing the year-to-date net income to $1.98 million, a 10.6% increase over June 30, 2016.
Net interest income of $9.7 million reported for June 30, 2017 improved $731 thousand over net interest income from June 30, 2016. Non-interest income is up 88.9% from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017.
Non-interest expense for the first half of 2017 is $7.5 million compared to $6.8 million for the first half of 2016. The change in salaries over that 12-month period was just $479 thousand, and as a result the efficiency ratio continues to demonstrate improvement.
The book value per common share is $11.30 as of June 30, 2017, up 6.1% from June 30, 2016. The share price closed on June 30, 2017 at $16.05 per common share, or 142% of book value. Per OTCQX Markets, “total share trading increased during the first half of 2017 vs. the same time period last year. Average daily volume in MNSB shares thru June 30, 2017 was 4,700 shares vs. 3,500 shares for the same time period last year. The Company’s share price was higher – up 12.92% in the first half of the year as well”.
QUOTES: “There is nothing more fulfilling than seeing a plan truly come together,” said Jeff W. Dick, Chairman and CEO of MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. and MainStreet Bank. “Our new President Chris Brockett has really hit the ground running – balancing his time between bringing on new talent and new business opportunities. This, combined with the shrinking competition in community banking due to M&A activities, is providing MainStreet with great opportunities without compromising our credit standards.”
President Chris Brockett added, “Our first quarter was a bit slower than planned, but our strong second quarter closed that gap and we are on-track with our strategic initiatives. I’m pleased to report that our recently added lenders and business bankers are performing ahead of expectations, and we anticipate a strong finish for 2017.”
