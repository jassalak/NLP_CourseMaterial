Here are a few questions our MainStreet banking customers have frequently asked. We thought you may find them useful. If there’s a question that has not been answered, please don’t hesitate to contact us.
First, before you open a Junior Airsavings, the adult must have a deposit account of your own (ex. Kasasa Cash, Kasasa Cash Back, Kasasa Saver). Once there is an established relationship with MainStreet Bank, in order to open a Junior Airsavings you will need the same information as a Kasasa account, but you’ll need it for both you and the adolescent. Here is the list:
Driver’s License/Personal ID Card
Both applicants Social Security # or Tax ID #
Contact Information
Employment Information (Please select Other for the child)
You can stop by one of our convenient branch locations to open up this account!
No, because the Kasasa Saver has a limitation to the amount of withdrawals you are allowed per statement cycle (6 withdrawals), we do not issue a Visa® debit card specifically for Kasasa Saver. However, if you have a Kasasa Cash or Kasasa Cash Back checking account, your Kasasa Saver account will be tied to the Visa® debit card that comes with your Kasasa Cash and Kasasa Cash Back checking account. You may then withdraw money from an ATM out of your Kasasa Saver account.
You may make 6 withdrawals (including account transfers) for each of your savings accounts. Each withdrawal beyond the initial free 6 will result in a $10 fee. The fee is only $5 for the Junior Airsavings account.
We will notify you as your birthday approaches and inform you that your Junior Airsavings will be transferred over to a Kasasa Saver account where the Kasasa Saver rates will apply. You can always check out our Kasasa Saver rates
Each application for an Aircharity account will undergo a verification process that will verify the account holder’s information and the information of the charity prior to providing the tools to help the charity begin collecting donations.
There are a couple subtle differences between applying for an Overdraft Line of Credit and a Secured Overdraft Line of Credit account. Once you’ve clicked on the link to apply for a Secured Overdraft Line of Credit, it will take you to the same page for the Overdraft Line of Credit.
Here is the information you will need:
Driver’s License
Contact Information
Employment Information
Previous Employment Information
Primary Reference Information
Current Asset (this must be your Kasasa Saver account)
One difference is how you answer the question: Will you be able to provide collateral for this loan?
Your approval for an Airbanking Visa Credit Card is based on the underwriting guidelines that we set. The rate is based on whether or not you are a MainStreet Bank deposit customer. You must have a Kasasa Cash or Kasasa Cash Back Checking account to qualify for the lower Annual Percentage Rate.
Rewards points are earned by making purchases using your Airbanking Visa Credit Card. Points are taken away should any items be returned. Points are not earned for cash advances, balance transfers, unauthorized or fraudulent charges or fees of any kind placed on your Airbanking Visa Credit Card.
Yes, they will expire. The Scorecard Rewards points expire after accumulating for 2 years. A notice is put into your monthly statement letting you know when points are due to expire soon. Also, if you close your Airbanking Visa Credit Card your Rewards points will expire. As long as your account is in good standing you will always be able to use your rewards points.
Pre-qualification is normally determined by a loan officer. After interviewing you, the loan officer determines the potential loan amount for which you may be approved. The loan officer does not issue loan approval; therefore, pre-qualification is not a commitment to lend.
After the loan officer determines that you pre-qualify, he/she then issues a pre-qualification letter. The pre-qualification letter is used when you make an offer on a property. The pre-qualification letter informs the seller that your financial situation has been reviewed by a professional, and you will likely be approved for a loan to purchase the home.
When your loan is pre-approved, you receive a pre-approval certificate. Getting your loan pre-approved allows you to close very quickly when you do find a home. Pre-approval can also help you negotiate a better price with the seller.
A rate lock is a lender’s promise to “lock” a specified interest rate and a specified number of points for you for a specified period of time while your loan application is processed.
During that time, interest rates may change. But if your interest rate and points are locked in, you should be protected against increases. However, a locked-in rate could also keep you from taking advantage of price decreases.
There are four components to a rate lock:
Loan program
Interest rate
Points
Length of the lock period
The longer the length of the lock period, the higher the points or the interest rate will be. This is because the longer the lock, the greater the risk for the lender offering that lock.
Loans where the borrowers’ down payment is less than 20% often require mortgage insurance, which can be provided privately or publicly.
Conventional loans requiring MI are insured by private mortgage insurance. FHA loans are those whose MI is provided by the Federal Housing Administration, a public, government program backed by taxpayers.
Both mortgage insurance options have premiums, often paid by the borrower. Each program has advantages and disadvantages depending on your unique situation.
This checklist outlines the principal documents and information that are generally required to complete the application. Additional documentation may be required, depending on the circumstances of your loan. By having the information available, you will save time and avoid delays.

There are a number of reasons that you may experience trouble accessing the mobile version of
Internet banking on your phone. To use the mobile version, your phone will need to meet the following
minimum requirements:
You must first enroll through traditional Internet banking before you can gain access.
Your mobile device must be Web-enabled.
Your mobile network must allow secure SSL traffic. (You may need to contact your mobile provider
to determine this.) If your phone meets these requirements and you continue experiencing problems,
the mobile version may not be compatible with your phone’s browser. An interim solution would
be to try downloading another browser such as Opera Mini (www.operamini.com), which provides
good support to a number of mobile applications.
