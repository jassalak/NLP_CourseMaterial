Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Papua New Guinea counterpart, Peter O’Neill, met in Sydney to sign the joint redevelopment agreement for the Lombrum Naval Base on Manus Island.

The deal will enhance interoperability between the near-neighbors’ militaries and lead to more Australian naval visits, the leaders said in a statement.

“I want to strengthen our engagement with the Pacific for the Pacific’s sake because this is our home,” Morrison said in a foreign policy speech.
