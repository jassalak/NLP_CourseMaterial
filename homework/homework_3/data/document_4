 To celebrate 75 years of John Deere partnering and supporting the National FFA organization, National FFA commissioned the Delphi FFA Chapter of Delphi, Ind., to completely restore a John Deere Model B tractor.

“When Piper Merritt, the 2017-2018 National FFA central region vice president visited our chapter during 2018 National FFA Week and saw four to five tractors we were restoring at the time in our shop, she mentioned that the National FFA Organization was looking for a chapter to restore a John Deere tractor,” said Doug Walker, adviser of the Delphi FFA Chapter.

Walker said Merritt called within days saying that the National FFA would like the Delphi Chapter to be the one to restore a John Deere tractor that would be presented at the National FFA Convention to honor the 75-year partnership between John Deere and FFA.
