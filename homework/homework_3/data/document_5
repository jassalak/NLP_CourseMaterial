A 6,000-year-old axe has been discovered at George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate.
A group of students and teachers participating in an archaeology field trip discover the stone axe head at Mount Vernon’s African American cemetery on Oct. 12.
According to a release, the axe – which is seven inches long and three inches wide – dates back to the fourth millennia BCE and would have been an important part of the Native American toolkit during that period.
