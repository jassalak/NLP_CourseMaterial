Joe Montana, forever linked with Dwight Clark, knows exactly how his old friend would have handled the unveiling of “The Catch” statue on Sunday morning.

“He’d be whispering in my ear: ‘You know they didn’t call it ‘The Throw’ for a reason,’ ” the quarterback joked.

Montana and more than 70 other former 49ers attended the unveiling ceremony at Gate A outside Levi’s Stadium. The twin statues feature an airborne Clark leaping high into the air for a fingertip catch, just as he did for “The Catch” against the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship game on Jan. 10, 1982.
