According to Polk County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Jonathan Blackmon, Hardin is a Rome native who worked with RomeCares and Floyd Sheriff’s officials to get the supplies to a disaster relief zone.

“We originally took in the supplies for the victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, but when Irma hit closer to home we felt it would be more beneficial to send them to Florida,” Blackmon said.

The team that went to Florida with the supplies helped with relief efforts in the Moore Haven area as well.
